# STEREO Extension
This folder contains the code for our extension of STEREO.
We extended STEREO to the Human-Computer-Interaction domain and added functionality for PDF and LaTeX files.
> See the [Technical Report STEREO](./Technical_Report_STEREO.pdf) for the original user manual. Some functionality is removed, e.g., ABAE and GBCE. For more information see the [Technical Report](../Technical_Report.pdf) for **this** project.

See the README.md in the sub-folder [Code](./Code) for information on how to use STEREO.
