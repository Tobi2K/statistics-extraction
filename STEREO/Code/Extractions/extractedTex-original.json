        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"The present work is a follow-up to a user study where subjects were asked to select which among two music lists they perceived to be more diverse.   The study is summarized as follows.  First, they had to listen to two lists of EM audio tracks and select the most diverse in terms of music features.   Afterwards, they had to compare two lists of four EM artists' photos and select the most diverse list according to their social salient attributes (e.g. gender, skin tone, age).   Finally, we mixed the former tasks presenting two lists formed by four artists\\u2019 photos and corresponding tracks, and participants had to consider both tracks' musical features and artists' attributes when assessing the diversity of the lists.  Regarding the material included in the study, we manually searched tracks and artists' data in several websites such as MusicBrainz, Wikipedia, AllMusic, and also in artists' websites and electronic music magazines.   The anonymized responses, a facsimile of the survey designed for the study, and the complete list of tracks and artists presented are publicly available,[<https://zenodo.org/record/4436649>] and for a comprehensive description of the study we refer to <cit.>.  The study was an activity of the TROMPA project,[An international, publicly-funded research project: <https://trompamusic.eu/>] and followed the personal data management and ethical protocols approved within this project.  As a follow-up, we conducted 7 semi-structured interviews with 14 participants of the study, divided into focus groups of 2-3 participants when possible (P2 and P3; P4 and P5; P6, P7, and P8; P9 and P10; P11, P12, and P13), if not interviewing them individually (P1; P14).   We choose to collect qualitative data through focus group interviews because the interviewees shared the experience of having previously participated in the aforementioned study.   This sense of belonging to a group has been proven to facilitate the participants in feeling safe when sharing their opinions, making it possible to collect spontaneous data occurring thanks to the interaction among them <cit.>.   Interviewees were balanced in terms of gender (8 male, 7 female), mostly from Europe (86%), aged 18-45, and all of them hold a bachelors' degree or higher.   The majority declared to have received formal music training (71%), while only a few of them affirmed to regularly engage in playing, DJing or producing any kind of music (35%).   Regarding their listening habits, most of them described their musical taste as varied (79%), while less declared to listen often to EM (71%), and even less within EM described their musical taste as varied (57%).   The interview was divided into two main parts, lasting for a total of one hour for the focus groups, and half an hour for the individual interviews.  In the first part, we asked participants to discuss their strategy to assess the diversity of a music list while participating in the study.  In the second part, we centered the discussion around participants' experiences with Music RS, and the role that diversity may play in that specific scenario.   Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish and Italian, and then transcribed in English.  We started the analysis of the transcripts by doing open coding, annotating the several themes and categories touched by the interviewees.   Following, a process of axial coding was performed to connect the distinct categories and identify the shared themes, finally collapsing our findings into two main themes, reported in the next section.    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Assessing the Diversity of a Music List   Interviewees mentioned several aspects related to what diversity means to them, and how it has been interpreted while comparing lists of tracks and artists.  When asked about their strategy in choosing the most diverse lists, they often started the discussion by self-identifying themselves as being or not experts in EM.   Those who do not identify as an expert of this genre highlighted how the diversity assessment has been mostly based on listenable characteristics.   Some of them also recognized how difficult it was to assess the diversity of the lists:  \\u201cIt was very difficult [...] at some point everything sounded very similar\\u201d  RPLUS MATCH , commented a participant who self-defined herself as a newcomer to EM.  Moreover, another newcomer to EM observed:  \\u201cIt was a mentally taxing task because I had to kind of create a small description of every track and compare them in my head\\u201d (P10).  On the contrary, interviewees affirming to be familiar with EM emphasized how they made use of prior knowledge for categorizing artists and tracks, also discussing how this could have led to some sort of preference or prejudice while evaluating diversity:  \\u201cI can feel like I can make a better decision of what is diverse [...] but then there is kind of a bias that comes based on the fact that I like this music a lot\\u201d  RPLUS MATCH .   Here, we observe a contrast between the higher difficulty of the newcomers and the role of prior knowledge for experts as a facilitator to assess diversity.   On the one hand, newcomers not having prior knowledge could rely more on generic listenable features while interacting with unknown music (e.g. tempo):   \\u201cPeople who don't know much about a particular genre, probably would agree on some things that are a bit more generic\\u201d  RPLUS MATCH .   At the same time, they can associate such features to generic or stereotypical representations of the unfamiliar genre:   \\u201c[...] this kind of prejudice or bias we have about music that we do not know because we get to know them through these representations of what is considered to be\\u201d (P12).  On the other hand, experts are assumed to be strongly reliant on their knowledge, which can stimulate inner reflections and thoughts:  \\u201c[Experts] add more layers of abstraction, or more complexities to the assessment of diversity\\u201d (P2)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"2\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"If everything sounds similar I may get tired after a bit\\u201d  RPLUS MATCH .  This relationship between diversity, choice difficulty, and overall satisfaction has been already found in several studies in the RS literature <cit.>.   Nonetheless, there is a contrast between diversity as opposed to monotony in the listening experience, to which participants associate different feelings.    On the one hand, there can be satisfaction in listening to what is considered familiar or expected, because of the immediate reward that can be gained:   \\u201cI get frustrated when you get caught going in the same loops, but it is at some level also slightly satisfying [...] it is kind of brain-numbing in a way\\u201d (P2)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"2\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Lastly, participants have been asked if they believe that recommendation diversity could be a tool for modifying prior beliefs with regards to a specific musical genre or culture.   They have also been asked to provide examples when they have experienced such a change in opinion due to the interaction with Music RS.   As a result, some of the participants presenting their experiences pointed out that, even when they initially disliked or had prejudices, algorithmic recommendations helped them in discovering new facets of previously disliked music genres, which they eventually ended up enjoying and listening to more often:  `From the idea of classical music that I had [...] quite boring and everything very similar, thanks to some recommendations I have been able to discover different styles and to be in the mood to try to listen to it\\u201d (P1)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"1\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Second, an IR visualization allows aggregate marks to be unfolded.  An unfolding operation\\u2014typically triggered by a user interaction event such as selection or brushing\\u2014augments the aggregate marks with a visualization of the individual fold statistics that contribute to the aggregate measures.  In the ongoing roulette example, the fold data would show the variation in proportion of spins that result in black and red numbers across each of the n=5 independent folds.  Additional examples from our experimental prototypes are described in Section\\u00a0<ref>.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion   The ability to unfold aggregate measures into repeated measurements  is a central contribution of the IR approach.  By graphically depicting the repeatability of a particular measure across multiple folds, IR provides users with important and easy-to-interpret cues as to the variability of a given measure.  Traditional visualization methods do not convey this information, meaning it is often not considered when predictive conclusions are made by users.  Another benefit of IR comes from the aggregation function.  In particular, embedding within the visualization pipeline an ability to aggregate categorical values such as statistical significance classification can lead to more accurate results.  Repeated measures combined with voting-based aggregation can, for instance, reduce the exposure to Type 1 errors when looking for statistically significant p-values.

        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"In this case, the examples show data for populations of neonates on a scatter plot, with the x position determined by weight and the y position determined by height.  A linear regression model was calculated in all three cases using the IR pipeline with n=5.  The five regression lines, one for each fold, are visible (\\u201cunfolded\\u201d) in the visualizations as red lines.  In addition, an aggregate best-fit linear model is shown in blue.  To explore how IR helps convey uncertainty during progressive analysis, we used the incremental sampling feature of the prototype to vary the number of samples while keeping all IR parameters constant.  In Figure\\u00a0<ref>(a), only 500 patients are included in the scatter plot.  As the varying slopes between the five red lines captures, there is relatively large disagreement across folds in the linear models they produce.  This uncertainty would be invisible in a traditional plot rendered without the folds.    As expected, the spread between the individual fold regression lines decreases as more patients are retrieved by the incremental query feature.  For example, Figure\\u00a0<ref>(b) shows the same visualization with the same n=5 folds.  However, this version includes data for 1,000 patients.  The larger sample size results in increased stability across the folds.  Part (c) of the same figure shows the same visualization with 2,500 patients.  We see little improvement in agreement across folds compared to 1,000 patients, suggesting that the rate of further gains in agreement will be slower to develop.  As previously stated, the improvement in agreement as sample size increases is as expected.  However, as evidenced by the \\u201crecent history\\u201d charts at casino roulette tables and the other examples referenced throughout this paper, visualizations are often assumed to be accurate.  Users often fail to consider issues of sample size or variation.  This use case shows that IR can effectively convey this variation in the data without careful modeling, and in a non-parametric way that avoids assumptions about the underlying distributions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 DecisionFlow2    To test IR within a more fully-featured exploratory visual analysis environment, we developed DecisionFlow2, a new IR-based version of our existing visual analysis system for high-dimensional temporal event sequence data <cit.>.  A screen capture of the DecisionFlow2 interface is shown in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Original DecisionFlow Design   The original version of DecisionFlow made heavy use of p-values to help users identify event types that had a statistically significant correlation to a user-specified outcome measure.  When visualizing medical data, for example, this approach allows users to find types of medical events (such as specific diagnoses, medications, and procedures) that\\u2014when appearing in a particular pattern in a patient's history\\u2014are associated with better or worse medical outcomes.    In the original DecisionFlow design, an interactive timeline at the top of the screen allows users to segment a cohort of event sequences based on the presence of so-called \\u201cmilestone\\u201d events.  For a given subgroup, DecisionFlow visualizes statistics for the potentially thousands of different types that occur between milestones with the goal of helping users identify good candidates for new milestones.  DecisionFlow conveys the event type statistics via an interactive bubble chart similar to the one seen in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.  In the bubble chart, each event type is represented by a circle whose x-axis position is determined by its positive support (the fraction of \\u201cgood outcome\\u201d event sequences that contain the event type).  Similarly, each circle's y-axis position is determined by its negative support (the fraction of \\u201cbad outcome\\u201d sequences with the event type).

One typical example of these items can be that \\u201cI like it when goals are hard to achieve in games\\u201d.  Moreover, the p value less than 0.05 reveals that the difference in the preference of hardcore players for in-game difficulties is significantly higher than casual players, given that lower mean scores indicate greater acknowledgements to the dimensions.       Socialization - Gratification:  Hardcore players tend to be gratified as they can make new friends outdoors and maintain relationships with others through  while casual players are more likely to have a neutral attitude towards these social activities.  The average score of hardcore players (mean = 3.3833) shows that they to some extent agree that  would enable them to \\u201cbe part of a group\\u201d or \\u201cmeet strangers outdoors\\u201d while the average score of casual players (mean = 4.2778) suggests that they generally \\u201cneither agree nor disagree\\u201d with these items in Socialization dimension.  Besides, the p value under 0.05 also indicates that the differences in socialization-related gratification between hardcore players and casual players is statistically significant.       Enjoyment - Gratification:  All players are gratified by the enjoyment  provides while hardcore players gain more enjoyment from playing the game.  This is because that both casual players and hardcore players scored averagely around 2, which indicates that they generally agree with the items in Enjoyment dimension.  A typical item is \\u201cI play  because it is fun\\u201d.   In addition, given hardcore players (mean = 2.2032) scored less than casual players (mean = 2.4848) and the p value is less than 0.05, it can be safely said (95% sure due to the confidence interval) that hardcore players gain significantly more pleasures in  compared to casual players.       Trendiness - Gratification: Given the mean scores of both casual players (mean = 5.9517) and hardcore players (mean = 5.7041) are close to 6 which stands for \\u201cDisagree\\u201d in our scale, the results suggest that all players generally do not reckon that  would enable them to \\u201clook cool/trendy/stylish\\u201d.  Despite that trendiness is not an important gratification, hardcore players are more likely to be gratified with the popularity of the game as they scored relatively lower than casual players in this dimension and the p value equals to 0.005 indicates the difference is statistically significant.        Competition - Gratification: All players are gratified by the competition in  yet hardcore players tend to be more satisfied when they perform better or beat others during the game.   This is because that the hardcore players (mean = 2.3317) generally agree the items in Competition dimension such as \\u201cI like to prove that I am one of the best players.\\u201d, while casual players would partially agree with these items given their mean is 2.7276 which is more close to \\u201c3 \\u2013 somewhat agree\\u201d.  Furthermore, the p value less than 0.05 also indicates that the perceived gratification from in-game competitions is significantly different between hardcore players and casual players.        Challenge - Gratification: In-game challenges do not result in gratification among casual players while hardcore players think that being \\u201ctested\\u201d is fine and are more gratified after overcoming the difficulties.  This result is first reflected in the data that casual player averagely scored up to 4.8020 which is close to \\u201c5 \\u2013 somewhat disagree\\u201d in Challenge dimension.  This means items such as \\u201cI feel proud when I master an aspect of \\u201d may not be the case among casual players.  In contrast, hardcore players tend to have a neutral attitude towards in-game challenges given their mean score in this dimension, 4.0038, is close to \\u201c4 \\u2013 neither agree nor disagree\\u201d.

We then explain that the company rejected a given individual\\u2019s loan application.  Afterwards, we randomly allocate study participants to one of two conditions: 50% of participants are provided the information that an ADS made the decision, and the other 50% are told that the decision-maker was a human being.  We then provide identical explanations regarding a decision to study participants in either condition, the exact specifications of which will be derived and explained in more detail shortly.  Finally, we measure perceptions of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST) through multiple measurement items, drawn (and partially adapted) from previous studies (INFF: Colquitt et al. <cit.>; TRST: Carter and B\\u00e9langer <cit.>, Chiu et al. <cit.>, Lee <cit.>).  Additionally, we measure AI literacy (AILIT) of study participants, with items partially derived from Long and Magerko <cit.> as well as Wilkinson et al. <cit.>.       Data and ADS We design and implement a functional ADS for our study\\u2014similarly to earlier work by the authors <cit.>.  The ADS consists of an ML model that predicts loan approval on unseen data and can output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset[<https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset> (last accessed: August 24, 2021)] on home loan application decisions, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on the platform .[ is the world\\u2019s largest data science community (<https://www.kaggle.com/>)]  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations.  It includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might, in practice, be used to train ADS <cit.>.  After removing data points with missing values, we are left with 480 observations, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  As it is common in ML-based applications, we use 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  As groundwork for the design of our ADS, after encoding and scaling the features, we train a random forest classifier <cit.>.  The classifier is then able to predict the (unseen) held-out labels\\u2014which it achieves with an out-of-bag accuracy of 80.1%.  We use this classifier as a basis for the scenarios and explanations that participants are confronted with.       Explanations Recall that 50% of study participants are assigned the ADS condition and 50% the human condition.  Both conditions are provided with identical explanations regarding the decisions\\u2014the only difference is that study participants in the ADS condition are told that the ADS provides the explanatory information.  In contrast, participants in the human condition are told that a company representative (i.e., a human) provides this information.  We now explain in more detail the provided explanations.  As noted earlier, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided by humans and ADS alike.  First, we disclose all features (applicant income, co-applicant income, etc., as mentioned earlier), including corresponding values (e.g., applicant income: $3,069 per month) for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our ADS denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ different settings to ensure generalizability.  We also explain to study participants the importance of these features in the decision-making process.  For that, we compute permutation feature importances <cit.> from our model and obtain the following hierarchy, ordered from most to least important: credit history > loan amount > applicant income > co-applicant income > property area > marital status > dependents > education > loan amount term > self-employment > gender.  Note that feature importance is a global explanation style, meaning that this ordered list will be identical for any setting (i.e., applicant).  For each setting, we finally provide three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable feature each is minimally altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection (e.g., the individual would have been granted the loan if, everything else unchanged, the co-applicant income had been at least $800 per month).  To ascertain which of the features are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them to increase their chances of being granted a loan\\u2014we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers.

Comparing the means of perceptions of informational fairness for both conditions reveals that the ADS condition (M=3.68) is perceived to be significantly fairer than the human condition (M=3.47).  For perceptions of trustworthiness, however, there is no significant difference between the conditions  RPLUS MATCH .  Hence, neither H1 nor H2 are supported by our analyses.  In fact, H1 is reversely supported, eventually suggesting that for our study setup, informational fairness perceptions tend to be higher towards the ADS compared to the human decision-maker.  Based on qualitative responses from study participants, we conjecture that this might be due to the perceived absence of emotions and subjectivity in automation.  Other potential reasons for this based on qualitative feedback are given in Section <ref>.  Note that this finding seems contradictory to some prior works\\u2019 results (e.g., Castelo et al. <cit.>), which raises doubts about the generalizability of such findings beyond specific domains.  Interestingly, when considering people\\u2019s AI literacy, these results change.  For this analysis, we split our data into two (approximately equal-sized) sub-samples along the median value of AI literacy.  We refer to one sample as high AI literacy participants and the other as low AI literacy participants.  We then conduct separate Mann-Whitney U tests for the two sub-samples.

According to, e.g., Atico <cit.>, this is also an area where ADS are commonly employed for high-stakes decision-making.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design       Overall setup We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: First, we reveal to study participants some basic information about the lending company\\u2014similarly to the study setup introduced in our earlier work <cit.>.  We then explain that the company rejected a given individual\\u2019s loan application.  Afterwards, we randomly allocate study participants to one of two conditions: 50% of participants are provided the information that an ADS made the decision, and the other 50% are told that the decision-maker was a human being.  We then provide identical explanations regarding a decision to study participants in either condition, the exact specifications of which will be derived and explained in more detail shortly.  Finally, we measure perceptions of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST) through multiple measurement items, drawn (and partially adapted) from previous studies (INFF: Colquitt et al. <cit.>; TRST: Carter and B\\u00e9langer <cit.>, Chiu et al. <cit.>, Lee <cit.>).  Additionally, we measure AI literacy (AILIT) of study participants, with items partially derived from Long and Magerko <cit.> as well as Wilkinson et al. <cit.>.       Data and ADS We design and implement a functional ADS for our study\\u2014similarly to earlier work by the authors <cit.>.  The ADS consists of an ML model that predicts loan approval on unseen data and can output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset[<https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset> (last accessed: August 24, 2021)] on home loan application decisions, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on the platform .[ is the world\\u2019s largest data science community (<https://www.kaggle.com/>)]  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations.  It includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might, in practice, be used to train ADS <cit.>.  After removing data points with missing values, we are left with 480 observations, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  As it is common in ML-based applications, we use 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  As groundwork for the design of our ADS, after encoding and scaling the features, we train a random forest classifier <cit.>.  The classifier is then able to predict the (unseen) held-out labels\\u2014which it achieves with an out-of-bag accuracy of 80.1%.  We use this classifier as a basis for the scenarios and explanations that participants are confronted with.       Explanations Recall that 50% of study participants are assigned the ADS condition and 50% the human condition.  Both conditions are provided with identical explanations regarding the decisions\\u2014the only difference is that study participants in the ADS condition are told that the ADS provides the explanatory information.  In contrast, participants in the human condition are told that a company representative (i.e., a human) provides this information.  We now explain in more detail the provided explanations.  As noted earlier, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided by humans and ADS alike.  First, we disclose all features (applicant income, co-applicant income, etc., as mentioned earlier), including corresponding values (e.g., applicant income: $3,069 per month) for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our ADS denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ different settings to ensure generalizability.  We also explain to study participants the importance of these features in the decision-making process.  For that, we compute permutation feature importances <cit.> from our model and obtain the following hierarchy, ordered from most to least important: credit history > loan amount > applicant income > co-applicant income > property area > marital status > dependents > education > loan amount term > self-employment > gender.  Note that feature importance is a global explanation style, meaning that this ordered list will be identical for any setting (i.e., applicant).  For each setting, we finally provide three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable feature each is minimally altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection (e.g., the individual would have been granted the loan if, everything else unchanged, the co-applicant income had been at least $800 per month).  To ascertain which of the features are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them to increase their chances of being granted a loan\\u2014we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable features are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  We finally provide counterfactual explanations for a random subset of three of these features per setting.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection  We conducted a between-subjects online study to test our hypotheses.  Participants for this study were recruited via [ is an online platform for recruiting high-quality research participants.] <cit.> and randomly assigned to either the human decision scenario or the ADS decision scenario.  Every participant was provided with two questionnaires associated with two different settings.  In each questionnaire, we asked participants to rate their agreement with multiple statements per construct on 5-point Likert scales <cit.>.  A score of 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and a score of 5 to \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  To be able to understand participants\\u2019 quantitative responses better, we included multiple open-ended questions as well.  We had to eliminate 4 of the 200 collected responses due to failure to pass an attention check\\u2014therefore, we analyzed 196 responses.  Among our participants, 62% were male, 36% female, and the remaining 2% referred to themselves as non-binary or did not disclose their gender at all; 42% were students, 29% employed full-time, 11% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 10% unemployed, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The average age of participants was 26.4 years.        \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS  Before conducting our tests, we assess the validity and reliability of our latent constructs (INFF, TRST, AILIT), each of which is measured through multiple items.  We note that average variance extracted (AVE) is above or equal to the recommended threshold of 0.5 for INFF and TRST, while the AVE of AILIT is 0.39.  According to Fornell and Larcker <cit.>, if the AVE value of a construct is low, its convergent validity can still be sufficient if composite reliability (CR) is above 0.6.  The CR of all our three constructs, INFF (0.83), TRST (0.94), and AILIT (0.72) is, in fact, above the threshold of 0.7, which is recommended by Barclay et al. <cit.>.  Therefore, our convergent validity is sufficient for AILIT as well.  Values for Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (CA) are larger than the recommended threshold of 0.7 for our three constructs, indicating good reliability <cit.>.  Validity and reliability measures are summarized in Table <ref>.           \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Comparison of perceptions  We conduct two Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.> to examine the differences in perceptions between ADS and human decision-makers.  The Mann-Whitney U test for informational fairness is statistically significant  RPLUS MATCH , suggesting a significant difference between participants\\u2019 perceptions of informational fairness.  Comparing the means of perceptions of informational fairness for both conditions reveals that the ADS condition (M=3.68) is perceived to be significantly fairer than the human condition (M=3.47).  For perceptions of trustworthiness, however, there is no significant difference between the conditions  RPLUS MATCH .  Hence, neither H1 nor H2 are supported by our analyses.  In fact, H1 is reversely supported, eventually suggesting that for our study setup, informational fairness perceptions tend to be higher towards the ADS compared to the human decision-maker.  Based on qualitative responses from study participants, we conjecture that this might be due to the perceived absence of emotions and subjectivity in automation.  Other potential reasons for this based on qualitative feedback are given in Section <ref>.  Note that this finding seems contradictory to some prior works\\u2019 results (e.g., Castelo et al. <cit.>), which raises doubts about the generalizability of such findings beyond specific domains.  Interestingly, when considering people\\u2019s AI literacy, these results change.  For this analysis, we split our data into two (approximately equal-sized) sub-samples along the median value of AI literacy.  We refer to one sample as high AI literacy participants and the other as low AI literacy participants.  We then conduct separate Mann-Whitney U tests for the two sub-samples.

We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.  Regarding the effectiveness of explanations, generally speaking, prior research has primarily focused on comparing individual explanation styles head-to-head (e.g., <cit.>), while little work has been done on evaluating the interplay of different styles, including potential complementarity.  <cit.> emphasize the sparsity of empirical work w.r.t. the effectiveness of explanations overall.        Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).  Overall, we find a significant effect between different conditions on perceptions of informational fairness (p < 0.001) as well as on perceptions of trustworthiness (p < 0.001).  A Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons shows that the effect for informational fairness is significant (p < 0.05) between all conditions except (Base) and (F).  The effect for trustworthiness is significant between (Base) and (FFI), (Base) and (FFICF), as well as (F) and (FFICF), and marginally significant between (F) and (FFI) (p = 0.052)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.052\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.

Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.

To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.

Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).  Overall, we find a significant effect between different conditions on perceptions of informational fairness  RPLUS MATCH  as well as on perceptions of trustworthiness (p < 0.001)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.001\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",
        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"This desideratum is closely linked to informational fairness of ADS <cit.>, as introduced earlier.  We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.  Regarding the effectiveness of explanations, generally speaking, prior research has primarily focused on comparing individual explanation styles head-to-head (e.g., <cit.>), while little work has been done on evaluating the interplay of different styles, including potential complementarity.  <cit.> emphasize the sparsity of empirical work w.r.t. the effectiveness of explanations overall.        Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.

We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.

While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.

Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.

Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.

However, 20% questioned the effectiveness of adhering to some of the counterfactual recommendations; especially regarding suggested changes to co-applicant income or property area: \\u201cThese factors do not change the fact that an applicant can or can not pay his/her debt\\u201d (#454).  Actionability of counterfactual scenarios was another important theme: 9% overall addressed this, being appreciative that some counterfactual scenarios are explicitly actionable (#836: \\u201cChanging the loan term is possible immediately\\u201d) and disenchanted when not (#462: \\u201cSome hardly achivable [sic] scenarios must be met to ensure the bank [will] be repayed [sic].\\u201d)  Some themes were addressed by fewer SPs but are highly interesting: one SP was, e.g., confused by the \\u201cdirection\\u201d of suggested changes: \\u201cInstead of a short loan amount term, it could be a bit longer\\u201d (#778).  Others were seemingly distracted by suggested changes that are (too) small: \\u201cThe incomes are so close to the required that it shouldn't matter\\u201d (#447).  Finally, some SPs hinted at potential inconsistencies between individual explanations: \\u201cIt seems odd that loan amount term is placed so low when it was one of the areas the individual could change to obtain the loan\\u201d (#435).     \\u00a7 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS   In this section, we link our quantitative results to qualitative insights to get a better understanding as to why certain effects were observed, and we analyze and discuss in more detail the findings from the fitted SEM.  Finally, we allude to several implications of our work.        Connecting quantitative and qualitative findings As observed in Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), both perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness increase as more explanations are provided to SPs\\u2014however, INFF at a much higher rate than TRST.  Interestingly, many SPs in the (Base) condition, who do not receive any further explanations w.r.t. the inner workings of the ADS, do not find this \\u201cblack-box\\u201d system to be overly problematic w.r.t. informational fairness: as can be seen in Fig.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), SPs' responses for INFF are approx. equally distributed across ratings 1\\u20134.  This might be due to people's expectations; one SP simply stated that this \\u201cseems to be standard practice\\u201d (#1212) in terms of explaining ADS.  From Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>) we infer that providing relevant factors (F) to SPs does not significantly increase INFF.  A likely reason for this observation is that SPs asked for significant follow-up information w.r.t. how the factors are used for decision-making.  Both the differences for (F)\\u2192(FFI) and (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) are significant for INFF.  Considering the qualitative findings (\\u00a0<ref>), this seems little surprising as the complementary explanations (e.g., factor importance in (FFI) over (F)) were specifically requested by SPs.   While some explanations clearly helped SPs understand the given ADS better, they also reveal certain aspects that might be detrimental to people's trust.  Similar to INFF, one might have expected to see lower ratings for TRST in the (Base) condition.  Instead, SPs' responses for TRST are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 3 (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, \\u00a0<ref>).  Regarding marginal effects of explanations on TRST, we note that none of (Base)\\u2192(F), (F)\\u2192(FFI), or (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) lead to statistically significant changes in SPs' perceptions.  As for (Base)\\u2192(F), SPs' trust appears to be hampered by the experience that certain (presumably) inappropriate factors (e.g., gender) are being considered by the ADS.

To evaluate effects of awareness of the data processed by the wearable technology on social acceptance, we examined participants' responses to the social acceptance questions repetitively asked before and after the user perspective video.  Note that the user video informed of the wearable camera's function of capturing visual attributes of pedestrians.  For this analysis, all the responses from the Glasses and GoPro groups were merged and used, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare their responses before and after the user video.      This figures draws a line between the mean scores of online sighted participants' responses to the PositiveAssistUse, PositiveAnyUse, PrivacyConcerns, and UncomfortableAssistUse questions before and after the user perspective video.  Following are the mean scores and standard deviations before and after the user video for each question.  [PositiveAssistUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=2.2, std=1.1 AfterUserVideo: mean=2.3, std=0.9  [PositiveAnyUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=1.0, std=1.6 AfterUserVideo: mean=0.6, std=2.0  [PrivacyConcerns] BeforeUserVideo: mean=-0.4, std=1.8 AfterUserVideo: mean=-0.2, std=2.0  [UncomfortableAssistUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=-1.4, std=1.7 AfterUserVideo: mean=-1.3, std=1.8    As illustrated in Figure\\u00a0<ref>, participants generally tended to be positive toward wearable camera technology if it was designed for assistive purpose after watching the passerby video and the user video.  However, we observed that more participants tended to become uncomfortable seeing people using such a wearable camera device in public spaces, even if it was for assistive purpose, after the user video  (UncomfortableAssistUse).  The number of participants who agreed to feeling uncomfortable increased after the user video (from 38 to 50 out of the 180 participants), but the difference was not statistically significant.

The SA probe correct response rates were higher than anticipated for all three models, which indicates that the Collective Interface Visualization was sufficient to enable operator situational awareness.  The consistently better SA_3 response percentages for human-collective teams using M_2 strongly suggests an advantage of this model over the other two for the human-operator.  Due to the simultaneous decision-making during the trials, associating individual SA probe questions to decision problem difficulty was not possible; however, these results suggest that future examination of SA probe responses under different decision difficulties is likely to further distinguish these models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Subjective Results       This section presents the subjective data including the operator's reported situational awareness, workload,  post-trial questionnaires, post-experiment questionnaires, and the Mental Rotation Tests.  The descriptive statistics for the 3-D SART and NASA-TLX are presented in Tables <ref> and <ref> <cit.>, respectively.  A Kruskal-Wallis test did not reveal significant effects between the models for the overall 3-D SART score, or any of the 3-D SART components.  The scores were similar across the models, but slightly higher for M_2.     A Kruskal-Wallis revealed no significant effects for the overall NASA-TLX score, but identified significant effects between the models for mental demand, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 22.166, \\u03c1 < 0.001, and temporal demand, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 8.8327, \\u03c1 = 0.012.  A pairwise  comparison using a Tukey and Kramer test revealed significant effects between M_1 and M_3  (\\u03c1 = 0.003) and M_2 and M_3 (\\u03c1 < 0.001) for mental demand.  A similar test revealed significant effects for Temporal Demand between M_1 and M_3 (\\u03c1 = 0.023) and between M_2 and M_3 (\\u03c1 = 0.032).  The operators reported higher mental and temporal demand when using models M_1 and M_2.  Higher mental demand indicates higher required perceptual or decision making activity.  The higher mental demand reported for M_1 and M_2 suggests that operators experienced higher demand when sharing decision making tasks with the other collectives.  When making decisions, as in M_3, the operators did not need to consider what the collective was doing.  The higher temporal demand is likely due to the fact that both models, M_1 and M_2, made independent decisions, whether the human operator intervened or not.  The use of these models likely introduced additional pressure on the human operator to move quickly in order to influence each collective's decisions, before the collective made an independent decision.  M_3 did not impose a similar pressure for the human operator to act.      The post-trial questionnaires required Likert scale responses, on a scale of 1 (worst) to 7 (best) regarding the effectiveness of each type of request, the collective model's responsiveness to requests, the collective model's independent target selection ability (Performance), and ease of understanding (Comprehension).   The descriptive statistics are shown in Tables <ref> and <ref>, respectively.  A Kruskal-Wallis test identified significant effects between the models for the effectiveness of the Abandon request, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.33, \\u03c1 = 0.04, and the model's independent performance, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.8, \\u03c1 = 0.03.  The fact that the operators rated the effectiveness of the Abandon request lowest for the baseline model is not surprising, since the model only persistently investigated targets dictated by the human.  The low performance reported for M_1 is consistent with the lower performance of the independent model, M_1 SIM, compared to M_2 SIM and the lower performance of the M_1 human-collective teams compared to the M_2 human collective teams.          The post experiment questionnaire required the operators to rank order the different models according to overall Responsiveness to requests, overall performance, and overall Comprehension.  The descriptive statistics for the post experimental rankings are summarized in Table <ref>.  A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant effects for Responsiveness, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 28) = 62.25, \\u03c1 < 0.001, and Comprehension, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 28) = 62.25, \\u03c1 < 0.001 (identical values).  The ranking of the baseline model, M_3 overall is interesting, as it was ranked consistently the lowest for responsiveness, the highest for comprehension, and between the remaining models for performance.    The final subjective metric was the Mental Rotations Test scores.  The MRT has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 24.  The operators' MRT scores resulted in a 10.9 mean score (standard deviation = \\u00b1 5.5, median = 10, minimum = 1, maximum = 24) <cit.>.  These results were virtually identical to the results of a large study comprised of 636 operators with a 10.8 mean score and a standard deviation of \\u00b1 5 <cit.>.
