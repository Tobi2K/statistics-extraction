Second, an IR visualization allows aggregate marks to be unfolded.  An unfolding operation\\u2014typically triggered by a user interaction event such as selection or brushing\\u2014augments the aggregate marks with a visualization of the individual fold statistics that contribute to the aggregate measures.  In the ongoing roulette example, the fold data would show the variation in proportion of spins that result in black and red numbers across each of the n=5 independent folds.  Additional examples from our experimental prototypes are described in Section\\u00a0<ref>.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion   The ability to unfold aggregate measures into repeated measurements  is a central contribution of the IR approach.  By graphically depicting the repeatability of a particular measure across multiple folds, IR provides users with important and easy-to-interpret cues as to the variability of a given measure.  Traditional visualization methods do not convey this information, meaning it is often not considered when predictive conclusions are made by users.  Another benefit of IR comes from the aggregation function.  In particular, embedding within the visualization pipeline an ability to aggregate categorical values such as statistical significance classification can lead to more accurate results.  Repeated measures combined with voting-based aggregation can, for instance, reduce the exposure to Type 1 errors when looking for statistically significant p-values.

        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"In this case, the examples show data for populations of neonates on a scatter plot, with the x position determined by weight and the y position determined by height.  A linear regression model was calculated in all three cases using the IR pipeline with n=5.  The five regression lines, one for each fold, are visible (\\u201cunfolded\\u201d) in the visualizations as red lines.  In addition, an aggregate best-fit linear model is shown in blue.  To explore how IR helps convey uncertainty during progressive analysis, we used the incremental sampling feature of the prototype to vary the number of samples while keeping all IR parameters constant.  In Figure\\u00a0<ref>(a), only 500 patients are included in the scatter plot.  As the varying slopes between the five red lines captures, there is relatively large disagreement across folds in the linear models they produce.  This uncertainty would be invisible in a traditional plot rendered without the folds.    As expected, the spread between the individual fold regression lines decreases as more patients are retrieved by the incremental query feature.  For example, Figure\\u00a0<ref>(b) shows the same visualization with the same n=5 folds.  However, this version includes data for 1,000 patients.  The larger sample size results in increased stability across the folds.  Part (c) of the same figure shows the same visualization with 2,500 patients.  We see little improvement in agreement across folds compared to 1,000 patients, suggesting that the rate of further gains in agreement will be slower to develop.  As previously stated, the improvement in agreement as sample size increases is as expected.  However, as evidenced by the \\u201crecent history\\u201d charts at casino roulette tables and the other examples referenced throughout this paper, visualizations are often assumed to be accurate.  Users often fail to consider issues of sample size or variation.  This use case shows that IR can effectively convey this variation in the data without careful modeling, and in a non-parametric way that avoids assumptions about the underlying distributions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 DecisionFlow2    To test IR within a more fully-featured exploratory visual analysis environment, we developed DecisionFlow2, a new IR-based version of our existing visual analysis system for high-dimensional temporal event sequence data <cit.>.  A screen capture of the DecisionFlow2 interface is shown in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Original DecisionFlow Design   The original version of DecisionFlow made heavy use of p-values to help users identify event types that had a statistically significant correlation to a user-specified outcome measure.  When visualizing medical data, for example, this approach allows users to find types of medical events (such as specific diagnoses, medications, and procedures) that\\u2014when appearing in a particular pattern in a patient's history\\u2014are associated with better or worse medical outcomes.    In the original DecisionFlow design, an interactive timeline at the top of the screen allows users to segment a cohort of event sequences based on the presence of so-called \\u201cmilestone\\u201d events.  For a given subgroup, DecisionFlow visualizes statistics for the potentially thousands of different types that occur between milestones with the goal of helping users identify good candidates for new milestones.  DecisionFlow conveys the event type statistics via an interactive bubble chart similar to the one seen in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.  In the bubble chart, each event type is represented by a circle whose x-axis position is determined by its positive support (the fraction of \\u201cgood outcome\\u201d event sequences that contain the event type).  Similarly, each circle's y-axis position is determined by its negative support (the fraction of \\u201cbad outcome\\u201d sequences with the event type).  Circle size and color encode correlation and odds ratio, respectively.

More specifically, the study provides an insight into the ways in which PIN and pattern selection (i.e., varying lengths and spatial characteristics) may impact accurate entry, and whether tactile-only feedback can support the spatialization process.    A shorter paper based on our initial work was accepted by the Workshop on Usable Security (USEC 2018) in the work-in progress track (entitled \\u201cWork-In-Progress: Performance of Eyes-Free Mobile Authentication\\u201d).  The paper provided a general overview of our study, along with preliminary analysis.  However, we have added additional content to all sections, and vastly extended the analysis focusing on classification techniques.  The three research questions described in the manuscript submitted to JISA have been addressed in significant detail, in contrast to our prior paper.  In the manuscript submitted to JISA, we have described the use of Dynamic Time Warping techniques to identify precision of the user, the ways in which edit distance measurements have been calculated, and our process and metrics used to classify interaction behaviors.  Six training classifications and ten entry classifications have been identified, which can be used by other researchers aiming to classify their own traces.  Findings from the qualitative analysis of our data has also been added to the manuscript to supplement the quantitative analysis presented.

   \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Design \\r \\r \\r All three keyboards are operated using a continuous input device.\\r To compare them in terms of gaze typing performance, we used an eye tracking system to translate the user's eye movements to cursor movements.\\r The eye tracker used in the experiment is Monocular Edge Analysis System from LC Technologies.\\r It has a sampling rate of 60\\u00a0Hz, and a gaze position estimation accuracy of 0.45.\\r In the experiments, the eye tracker is used from a typical distance of 50\\u00a0cm.\\r The calibration was repeated before the use of each keyboard.\\r \\r The experiment was conducted with 37 undergraduate and graduate computer and electrical-electronics engineering students.\\r None of the participants have used an eye tracker before.\\r The participants were not asked to remove their glasses or contact lenses.\\r They were given written usage instructions for each keyboard prior to the experiment.\\r After reading the

asked to gaze-type a different paragraph with each keyboard.\\r The paragraphs were chosen to represent the complexity of daily conversation.\\r \\r Instead of having the participants read from the source material, we dictated it to them.\\r This was done to emulate typing as a means of communication.\\r The participants were asked to type as much of the text as possible in 5 minutes.\\r The participants were instructed to correct any errors they may make before the session, but they were not actively notified of their errors during the session.\\r \\r Both the keyboard order and

enabled.\\r \\r After the experiment was finished, the participants were asked which keyboard they would prefer to use if operating a soft keyboard with an eye tracker was their only means of

\\r    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results \\r \\r Let us begin by emphasizing again that the experiment were conducted with novice users.\\r Both the text entry rates and preferences are likely to change as the

to note that the soft keyboard in\\u00a0<cit.>, eOSK, was an early prototype of SliceType that did not include key merging.\\r Therefore, the mouse experiment result for SliceType is not very representative.\\r \\r \\r \\r As seen in Table\\u00a0<ref>, SliceType has the highest text entry rate in both experiments, but the ranking between Dasher and GazeTalk is reversed.\\r The difference between the results obtained in this experiment and the results from our previous experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> has an obvious explanation.\\r The experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> was conducted using a mouse as the input device, while the experiment presented in this paper is conducted with an eye tracker.\\r Table\\u00a0<ref> shows that the usage of the eye tracker nearly halved the number of words entered using Dasher and SliceType, while it did not affect GazeTalk's performance much.\\r Both Dasher and SliceType require high fidelity input, yet GazeTalk's larger keys allow the use of a less accurate input device.\\r Even though SliceType's performance deteriorated when used with an eye tracking system, it still performs the best among the three keyboards.\\r \\r \\r \\r To compare the

between the results obtained in this experiment and the results from our previous experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> has an obvious explanation.\\r The experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> was conducted using a mouse as the input device, while the experiment presented in this paper is conducted with an eye tracker.\\r Table\\u00a0<ref> shows that the usage of the eye tracker nearly halved the number of words entered using Dasher and SliceType, while it did not affect GazeTalk's performance much.\\r Both Dasher and SliceType require high fidelity input, yet GazeTalk's larger keys allow the use of a less accurate input device.\\r Even though SliceType's performance deteriorated when used with an eye tracking system, it still performs the best among the three keyboards.\\r \\r \\r \\r To compare the mean text entry rates of keyboards, we conducted a one-way ANOVA, which indicated significant entry rate variance with respect to the keyboard type ( RPLUS MATCH  ).\\r To analyze the results further, we applied post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction\\u00a0(see Table\\u00a0<ref>).\\r It can be seen that there is a very significant difference between the text entry rates achieved with Dasher and SliceType.\\r The difference between GazeTalk and SliceType is less pronounced (p\\u226e0.05).\\r As an additional result of our experiment, we have observed that the text entry rate was significantly higher with GazeTalk, compared to Dasher.\\r \\r \\r \\r In Figure\\u00a0<ref>, the participants were grouped based on their character entry rate with each keyboard.\\r That is, the percentages of the participants who typed less than 50 characters, in between 50 and 100 characters and more than 100 characters using each keyboard are illustrated.\\r It is clear from the figure that the majority of the users were not able to use Dasher efficiently.\\r This shows the difficult learning curve of Dasher.\\r With GazeTalk, most of the users were able to type at an average speed.\\r Only a few users were able to reach very high typing speeds of 100 or more characters.\\r With SliceType, many participants were able to reach an average typing speed of 50 to 100 characters, while as many participants were able to reach high typing speeds of more than 100 characters.\\r This shows that SliceType is easy to learn and use, and the users can speed up even more with a little practice.\\r Only a small percentage of the participants were not able to use SliceType efficiently.\\r If we examine the average entry rate of these participants across keyboards, we can see that they are all below average.\\r This implies that the participants who underperformed with SliceType may have suffered from a more general problem.\\r This can include variations in eye tracker performance based on the individual, participants' level of motivation and proficiency with computers.\\r \\r \\r \\r Finally, the participants were asked to rate the keyboards in terms of their order of preference.\\r The results are illustrated in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.\\r Recall that both the experiments and the survey were conducted blindly to prevent any bias towards a keyboard.\\r The participants were also not informed of their text entry rates with the keyboards before filling out the survey.\\r Intuitively, we can expect the users to prefer the keyboards that they can type faster with.\\r The results of the survey can be summarized as follows:\\r \\r \\r \\t   * 46% of the users ranked the keyboards in the same order with their typing speed.\\r \\t   * 59% of the participants ranked the keyboard that they typed fastest with as the best.\\r \\t   * 65% of the participants ranked the keyboard that they typed slowest with as the worst. \\r \\r \\r \\r \\r While it is obvious that there is a correlation between typing speed and preference, it may not be as strong as it is assumed to be.\\r 41% percent of the users do not prefer the keyboard that they type fastest with.\\r This may indicate that focusing solely on the text entry speed while designing a soft keyboard is rather questionable.\\r 68% of the participants type fastest with SliceType, while only 54% of the participants prefer SliceType as the best keyboard.\\r This shows that any design improvements to SliceType should be on usability, rather than text entry speed.\\r Participants' individual performances and preference rankings are shown in Figure\\u00a0<ref>.\\r \\r \\r \\r We applied aligned-rank transform to the ordinal survey data, and conducted a one-way ANOVA test, similar to the test done for text entry rate.\\r The results indicated very significant variance in preference with respect to the keyboard (F(2,108)=18.476,\\u00a0p<0.001\", \"statisticType\":

Placement of Predictions \\r \\r In Section\\u00a0<ref>, the importance of the method of delivery for prediction proposals was emphasized.\\r Placing all predictions in a single area of the layout has many downsides.\\r Instead, we have proposed to place each related prediction inside a key.\\r In this part, we will try to quantify the achieved user performance improvement using the Fitts' law.\\r Since key merging is irrelevant in this matter, we will use the Fitts' law ID result of the second condition (see Sec.\\u00a0<ref>).\\r When the user uses the predictions in the keys, the Fitts' law ID was calculated to be 40.40. \\r \\r The alternative way of presenting the predictions was assumed to be placing them at the top-left corner.\\r Obviously, not all predictions will fit in that area, as we propose up to 26 predictions at a time.\\r However, we will assume that all predictions can fit in the top left area, and the user can read them as easily as they read them in the proposed method.\\r The user is assumed to check the predictions after typing each letter to see if the word to be entered is among the predictions.\\r This adds a substantial amount of extra gaze movement, which directly translates as a Fitts' law cost.\\r Using the same sample text, the Fitts' law ID score is calculated to be 109.37.\\r We can see that simply moving the predictions inside the keys results in a 63.1% decrease in the Fitts' law ID.\\r \\r    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of the Results \\r \\r \\r \\r The Fitts' law indices of performance (IDs) calculated under different conditions are presented in Table\\u00a0<ref>.\\r As expected, adding the word prediction and key merging features resulted in a decrease in ID, which will translate to faster text entry.\\r The case in which both predictions are utilized and keys are merged performed best with an ID of 30.13.\\r In contrast with this result, the condition in which predictions and key merging are disabled performed worst with an ID of 49.02.\\r The difference cannot be interpreted as a 38.5% speed up, because as we have discussed in the beginning of this section, ID is multiplied by a parameter (b) and the result is added with another parameter (a) to find the total time needed for the user to travel through the designated path.\\r However, we can assume that lower ID will correspond to faster typing.\\r \\r The more interesting results are seen for the cases in which only one of the features is implemented.\\r Word prediction is commonly implemented by soft keyboards as it is obvious that typing less characters will result in faster text entry.\\r However, we see that the proposed key merging functionality will improve performance significantly more than using word predictions.\\r Only using word predictions results in an ID of 40.40, while only using key merging results in an ID of 33.68.\\r We can say that soft keyboard designers should invest more of their focus in effective allocation of area, as doing so may produce better results, even if the total number of actions to enter a piece of text would increase.\\r \\r \\r \\r   \\u00a7 EXPERIMENTS \\r \\r In this Section, we present the results of our experiment where we compared SliceType with two other publicly available gaze typing keyboards, Dasher\\u00a0<cit.> and GazeTalk\\u00a0<cit.>.\\r These keyboards were chosen to cover a wide variety of design choices.\\r SliceType and GazeTalk perform dwelling based selection, while Dasher employs continuous gestures.\\r Itoh et al. have compared GazeTalk and Dasher for typing in Japanese, and predicted Dasher to be better in the long-term\\u00a0<cit.>.\\r To our knowledge, this is the only other study in the literature that compared gaze typing soft keyboards directly.\\r \\r    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Design \\r \\r \\r All three keyboards are operated using a continuous input device.\\r To compare them in terms of gaze typing performance, we used an eye tracking system to translate the user's eye movements to cursor movements.\\r The eye tracker used in the experiment is Monocular Edge Analysis System from LC Technologies.\\r It has a sampling rate of 60\\u00a0Hz, and a gaze position estimation accuracy of 0.45.\\r In the experiments, the eye tracker is used from a typical distance of 50\\u00a0cm.\\r The calibration was repeated before the use of each keyboard.\\r \\r The experiment was conducted with 37 undergraduate and graduate computer and electrical-electronics engineering students.\\r None of the participants have used an eye tracker before.\\r The participants were not asked to remove their glasses or contact lenses.\\r They were given written usage instructions for each keyboard prior to the experiment.\\r After reading the instructions, each participant was individually taught how the eye tracking system and each keyboard works for a total of thirty minutes.\\r After this brief training session, the participants were asked to gaze-type a different paragraph with each keyboard.\\r The paragraphs were chosen to represent the complexity of daily conversation.\\r \\r Instead of having the participants read from the source material, we dictated it to them.\\r This was done to emulate typing as a means of communication.\\r The participants were asked to type as much of the text as possible in 5 minutes.\\r The participants were instructed to correct any errors they may make before the session, but they were not actively notified of their errors during the session.\\r \\r Both the keyboard order and keyboard\\u2013paragraph matching were permuted to prevent any bias.\\r The keyboards were sized to cover the left-half of a 21\\\" screen with 1920\\u00d71080 resolution.\\r The parameters for each keyboard were kept as their default values.\\r That is, the dwell period for both SliceType and GazeTalk were set to 1000 ms, and for Dasher, the speed was set to 0.8 with adaptive speed adjustment enabled.\\r \\r After the experiment was finished, the participants were asked which keyboard they would prefer to use if operating a soft keyboard with an eye tracker was their only means of communication.\\r The participants put the keyboards in the order of preference.\\r The reasoning behind this question was that although a user may type slowly using a keyboard, they may had a better user experience with it, and vice versa.\\r The experiment and the survey were done blindly, meaning that the participants were not informed about which keyboard was being developed in this study.\\r \\r    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results \\r \\r Let us begin by emphasizing again that the experiment were conducted with novice users.\\r Both the text entry rates and preferences are likely to change as the users gain proficiency.\\r Therefore, the results should be considered as an early prediction, rather than a conclusion.\\r \\r \\r \\r Figure\\u00a0<ref> illustrates the average number of characters entered by all participants in 5 minutes.\\r Clearly, SliceType provides the highest text entry rate, while the participants performed poorly with Dasher.\\r We compared these results with the ones of our previous experiment\\u00a0<cit.> in Table\\u00a0<ref>.\\r The results from Figure\\u00a0<ref> are converted to words per minute (wpm) using the 5 characters per word standard.\\r It is important to note that the soft keyboard in\\u00a0<cit.>, eOSK, was an early prototype of SliceType that did not include key merging.\\r Therefore, the mouse experiment result for SliceType is not very representative.\\r \\r \\r \\r As seen in Table\\u00a0<ref>, SliceType has the highest text entry rate in both experiments, but the ranking between Dasher and GazeTalk is reversed.\\r The difference between the results obtained in this experiment and the results from our previous experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> has an obvious explanation.\\r The experiment in\\u00a0<cit.> was conducted using a mouse

significant, while the preference over GazeTalk is not strictly significant (p\\u226e0.05).\\r Similar to the character entry rates, we can observe that GazeTalk is significantly better preferred over Dasher.\\r \\r \\r \\r In Section\\u00a0<ref>, we have mentioned that we have instructed the participants to correct their errors beforehand.\\r However, the entries by some participants included errors due to oversights, time limitation and a simple failure to operate the deletion mechanism of the keyboard.\\r To test if the keyboard type had any effect on the number of errors, we first need to define what is to be considered an error.\\r We defined consecutive incorrect characters to be a single error.\\r For example, entering \\u201cktboard\\\" instead of \\u201ckeyboard\\\" counts as a single error.\\r According to this definition, we applied one-way ANOVA, and observed that the number of errors did not change with different keyboards significantly (F(2,108)=2.417,\\u00a0p=0.094\",

To evaluate effects of awareness of the data processed by the wearable technology on social acceptance, we examined participants' responses to the social acceptance questions repetitively asked before and after the user perspective video.  Note that the user video informed of the wearable camera's function of capturing visual attributes of pedestrians.  For this analysis, all the responses from the Glasses and GoPro groups were merged and used, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare their responses before and after the user video.      This figures draws a line between the mean scores of online sighted participants' responses to the PositiveAssistUse, PositiveAnyUse, PrivacyConcerns, and UncomfortableAssistUse questions before and after the user perspective video.  Following are the mean scores and standard deviations before and after the user video for each question.  [PositiveAssistUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=2.2, std=1.1 AfterUserVideo: mean=2.3, std=0.9  [PositiveAnyUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=1.0, std=1.6 AfterUserVideo: mean=0.6, std=2.0  [PrivacyConcerns] BeforeUserVideo: mean=-0.4, std=1.8 AfterUserVideo: mean=-0.2, std=2.0  [UncomfortableAssistUse] BeforeUserVideo: mean=-1.4, std=1.7 AfterUserVideo: mean=-1.3, std=1.8    As illustrated in Figure\\u00a0<ref>, participants generally tended to be positive toward wearable camera technology if it was designed for assistive purpose after watching the passerby video and the user video.  However, we observed that more participants tended to become uncomfortable seeing people using such a wearable camera device in public spaces, even if it was for assistive purpose, after the user video  (UncomfortableAssistUse).  The number of participants who agreed to feeling uncomfortable increased after the user video (from 38 to 50 out of the 180 participants), but the difference was not statistically significant.

A Kruskal-Wallis test did not reveal significant effects between the models for the overall 3-D SART score, or any of the 3-D SART components.  The scores were similar across the models, but slightly higher for M_2.

A similar test revealed significant effects for Temporal Demand between M_1 and M_3 (\\u03c1 = 0.023) and between M_2 and M_3 (\\u03c1 = 0.032).  The operators reported higher mental and temporal demand when using models M_1 and M_2.  Higher mental demand indicates higher required perceptual or decision making activity.  The higher mental demand reported for M_1 and M_2 suggests that operators experienced higher demand when sharing decision making tasks with the other collectives.  When making decisions, as in M_3, the operators did not need to consider what the collective was doing.  The higher temporal demand is likely due to the fact that both models, M_1 and M_2, made independent decisions, whether the human operator intervened or not.  The use of these models likely introduced additional pressure on the human operator to move quickly in order to influence each collective's decisions, before the collective made an independent decision.  M_3 did not impose a similar pressure for the human operator to act.      The post-trial questionnaires required Likert scale responses, on a scale of 1 (worst) to 7 (best) regarding the effectiveness of each type of request, the collective model's responsiveness to requests, the collective model's independent target selection ability (Performance), and ease of understanding (Comprehension).   The descriptive statistics are shown in Tables <ref> and <ref>, respectively.  A Kruskal-Wallis test identified significant effects between the models for the effectiveness of the Abandon request, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.33, \\u03c1 = 0.04, and the model's independent performance, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.8, \\u03c1 = 0.03.  The fact that the operators rated the effectiveness of the Abandon request lowest for the baseline model is not surprising, since the model only persistently investigated targets dictated by the human.  The low performance reported for M_1 is consistent with the lower performance of the independent model, M_1 SIM, compared to M_2 SIM and the lower performance of the M_1 human-collective teams compared to the M_2 human collective teams.

The post-trial questionnaires required Likert scale responses, on a scale of 1 (worst) to 7 (best) regarding the effectiveness of each type of request, the collective model's responsiveness to requests, the collective model's independent target selection ability (Performance), and ease of understanding (Comprehension).   The descriptive statistics are shown in Tables <ref> and <ref>, respectively.  A Kruskal-Wallis test identified significant effects between the models for the effectiveness of the Abandon request, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.33, \\u03c1 = 0.04, and the model's independent performance, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 84) = 6.8, \\u03c1 = 0.03.  The fact that the operators rated the effectiveness of the Abandon request lowest for the baseline model is not surprising, since the model only persistently investigated targets dictated by the human.  The low performance reported for M_1 is consistent with the lower performance of the independent model, M_1 SIM, compared to M_2 SIM and the lower performance of the M_1 human-collective teams compared to the M_2 human collective teams.          The post experiment questionnaire required the operators to rank order the different models according to overall Responsiveness to requests, overall performance, and overall Comprehension.  The descriptive statistics for the post experimental rankings are summarized in Table <ref>.  A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant effects for Responsiveness, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 28) = 62.25, \\u03c1 < 0.001, and Comprehension, \\u03c7^2(2, N = 28) = 62.25, \\u03c1 < 0.001 (identical values).  The ranking of the baseline model, M_3 overall is interesting, as it was ranked consistently the lowest for responsiveness, the highest for comprehension, and between the remaining models for performance.    The final subjective metric was the Mental Rotations Test scores.  The MRT has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 24.  The operators' MRT scores resulted in a 10.9 mean score (standard deviation = \\u00b1 5.5, median = 10, minimum = 1, maximum = 24) <cit.>.  These results were virtually identical to the results of a large study comprised of 636 operators with a 10.8 mean score and a standard deviation of \\u00b1 5 <cit.>.  The results of the MRT were compared to the human-collective team success rates for each problem type.  A Spearman correlations test only identified weak to moderate positive correlations between the MRT results and success rates with model M_1 for overall, RPLUS MATCH , \\u03c1 < 0.001, easy, RPLUS MATCH , \\u03c1 = 0.03, and difficult decisions, r = 0.36\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

In addition, given hardcore players (mean = 2.2032) scored less than casual players (mean = 2.4848) and the p value is less than 0.05, it can be safely said (95% sure due to the confidence interval) that hardcore players gain significantly more pleasures in  compared to casual players.       Trendiness - Gratification: Given the mean scores of both casual players (mean = 5.9517) and hardcore players (mean = 5.7041) are close to 6 which stands for \\u201cDisagree\\u201d in our scale, the results suggest that all players generally do not reckon that  would enable them to \\u201clook cool/trendy/stylish\\u201d.  Despite that trendiness is not an important gratification, hardcore players are more likely to be gratified with the popularity of the game as they scored relatively lower than casual players in this dimension and the p value equals to 0.005 indicates the difference is statistically significant.        Competition - Gratification: All players are gratified by the competition in  yet hardcore players tend to be more satisfied when they perform better or beat others during the game.   This is because that the hardcore players (mean = 2.3317) generally agree the items in Competition dimension such as \\u201cI like to prove that I am one of the best players.\\u201d, while casual players would partially agree with these items given their mean is 2.7276 which is more close to \\u201c3 \\u2013 somewhat agree\\u201d.  Furthermore, the p value less than 0.05 also indicates that the perceived gratification from in-game competitions is significantly different between hardcore players and casual players.        Challenge - Gratification: In-game challenges do not result in gratification among casual players while hardcore players think that being \\u201ctested\\u201d is fine and are more gratified after overcoming the difficulties.  This result is first reflected in the data that casual player averagely scored up to 4.8020 which is close to \\u201c5 \\u2013 somewhat disagree\\u201d in Challenge dimension.  This means items such as \\u201cI feel proud when I master an aspect of \\u201d may not be the case among casual players.  In contrast, hardcore players tend to have a neutral attitude towards in-game challenges given their mean score in this dimension, 4.0038, is close to \\u201c4 \\u2013 neither agree nor disagree\\u201d.  This suggests that at least some items or some situations illustrated in the items correctly describe the gratification that hardcore players gained from challenges so that the overall score reached a relatively balanced point.

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.

The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders (U=1063.50, p=.001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".001\", \"U\": \"1063.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p<.00001).                                                        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving life-based images                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=74.407, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p=.001).                     Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p=.002).                     A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers (U=1089.00, p=.001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".001\", \"U\": \"1089.00\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others (U=1085.50, p=.001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".001\", \"U\": \"1085.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD (U=758.50, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"758.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).

A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented (U=862.50, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"862.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).

A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session (U=801.00, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"801.00\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.

Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).

The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions (U=940.00,  p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"940.00\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others (U=1007.50, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"1007.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.

Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t             \\t            \\tMaterial used in the therapy sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Inserting new material (U=862.50, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"862.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p<.00001).                                                        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving life-based images                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=74.407, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p=.001).                     Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p=.002).                     A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).

A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t             \\t            \\tMaterial used in the therapy sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Inserting new material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Inserting material topics ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Creating a favorites section in each patient's material (U=937.00, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".00001\", \"U\": \"937.00\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t             \\t            \\tMaterial used in the therapy sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Inserting new material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Inserting material topics ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Creating a favorites section in each patient's material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t                 Help tools for the users:         \\t             \\t           * Email/Telephone (U=1276.50, p=.018\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".018\", \"U\": \"1276.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the interest in the functionality and the overall daily stress (r_s(601)=.100, p=.014), and the amount of work with the PwD (r_s(601)=.108, p=.0.008).                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving interest-based images                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=77.558, p<.00001).

A Spearman's rank-order correlation determined that there is a positive correlation between the amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD (r_s(601)=.083, p=.040) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting current session                       The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=50.294, p<.00001).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for two of the pairs: do not want vs want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-98.201, p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (\\u03c7^2(2)=-133.992, p<.00001).                     The Spearman's rank-order correlation shows a positive correlation between the amount of work of caregivers with the PwD (r_s(601)=.099, p=.015) and level of interest in the functionality.                                                       \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Adapting future sessions                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=38.561, p<.00001).                     A pairwise post-hoc Dunn test with Bonferroni adjustments was significant for the pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), and do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001).               Conducting reminiscence therapy sessions does not seem to be associated with the level of interest in any of the technological functionalities presented.         Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t             \\t            \\tMaterial used in the therapy sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Inserting new material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Inserting material topics ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Creating a favorites section in each patient's material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t                 Help tools for the users:         \\t             \\t           * Email/Telephone ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Help within application (U=1168.50, p=.004\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".004\", \"U\": \"1168.50\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=81.234, p<.00001).

Caregivers that are not interested in creating an LSB are less interested in the aforementioned technological functionalities than those interested in having one, and in the majority, those that want to create an LSB are slightly more interested than those that might want to create the LSB.         With a higher overall stress of the caregiver, the interest in Retrieving life-based images appears to increase.         A higher amount of work of the caregiver with the PwD increases the interest in Retrieving life-based images, Retrieving interest-based images, and Adapting current session.                          \\u00a7 SURVEY 2           In this section, we present our results regarding sample characteristics (of caregivers), how reminiscence sessions are conducted, and how the results of reminiscence sessions (and overall health of the PwD) are evaluated in follow-up medical appointments.     Finally, we assess the level of interest in technological functionalities to help in the care of PwD (management of patients, information related to sessions carried out, management of the multimedia material to be used in sessions, and which help tools should be available), and how this interest differs between formal and informal caregivers.          The privacy of the information exchanged is very important, especially when other people are involved.     Beyond ethical issues, the non-guarantee of privacy may even hinder the embrace of new technology from caregivers.     As such, we also address how comfortable caregivers would be inserting personal content on technological solutions (assuming that only authorized people would be able to consult the data).               \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Informal Caregivers               Following, we detail the results obtained for the informal caregivers.         Where relevant, we compare the results with those of the previous study.                  \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                   A total of 102 informal caregivers worldwide answered our survey.             Ninety two percent were female, younger than 70 y-o (90%), completed higher education (65%), and have mild to moderate visual impairments (58%).             They usually take care of one PwD (87%) that is either they spouse (39%) or a relative (53%).              Usually, the PwD they look after are in a state that is perceived as severe (61%).             Finally, the average number of hours in the day that the caregiver spend caring for the PwD is above 8 (equivalent to a full-time job)  (60%).                              Most caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones five to six days a week, and computers/tablet/iPad three to four days a week.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Forty-one percent of caregivers perform reminiscence therapy with the PwD they care for.             The number of sessions conducted per month is either more than 10 (43%), 3-4 (21%) or 1-2 (21%).             Sessions occur mainly at home (88%), with an average duration of less than 30 minutes (74%).                          It is worth noting that the performance of the reminiscence sessions decreased compared to the previous survey (about 20%).             We believe it is due to the fact that informal caregivers are increasingly overburdened and subject to high levels of stress, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic situation experienced at the time of data collection.             Moreover, we believe the existing confinements due to the pandemic increased the isolation of the PwD, decreasing the contact between them and their relatives, both at home and in the institutions, which conditioned the realization of the therapy, and made it difficult to gather materials for the sessions.                          Images (88%), music (67%), and videos (43%) are used as triggers to stimulate the memory of PwD, and are mostly personal (95%).             They are related to the relatives of the PwD (93%), jobs and places the person visited (62% each), places where the person lived (57%), pets (52%), vehicles they had (33%), among others (23%), such as parties/happy moments, favorite activities, childhood memories, food, and dance.             Such materials are provided mainly by relatives of the PwD (81%), friends (29%), the person itself (21%), or  gathered from the internet (40%).             Caregivers would like to use other multimedia more often: videos (52%), images (38%), and music/text (29% each).             Images and music usually elicit positive emotional reactions in the PwD (71% each), while images (26%) and videos/text (24% each) usually elicit negative emotional reactions.                                                Caregivers update the material on a daily (29%),  monthly (26%), or weekly (17%) basis.             The main reasons that keep them from updating the material more often are: the detachment of the PwD (50%), lack of time (30%), and lack of materials (20%).             Seventeen percent of the caregivers never update the material.             We also believe that the caregivers' overload and stress, as well as the pandemic situation has affected not only the completion of the reminiscence therapy, but its quality when performed since caregivers did not have the time or materials available to diversify the following sessions.                           Regarding the information collected by the caregivers from each session, they register the materials that elicited positive emotional reactions (57%), materials that helped to recall past memories (55%), the emotional state of the PwD both before and after the session (38% each), and the material that elicited negative emotional reactions (19%).             There are no other types of information that caregivers would like to include in their notes about each session.             Fourteen percent of caregivers do not collect any information.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                                             Thirty-seven percent of surveyed caregivers take the PwD to follow-up medical appointment, in particular they accompany the PwD on a daily (32%) or weekly (16%) basis.             Thirty-four percent of caregivers reported that the PwD do not go to follow-up appointments despite having indicated they did in the previous question.              We believe this is due to not having immediately understood the concept of follow-up appointment.             Caregivers report they do not attend the appointments more often due to lack of time.                      The emotional reactions and emotional well-being of the PwD is usually analysed during the appointments (64% each), as well as the results from previous reminiscence sessions (48%).             Additionally, caregivers perform other follow-up of PwD besides medical consultations or reminiscence therapy, such as cognitive stimulation, walks in places PwD used to enjoy, art therapy, shopping, visiting places where PwD lived, psychomotricity activities, daily contact with the PwD, and gathering relevant information through collaborators/health team.                          \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                       Thirty three percent of caregivers take advantage of technology to take care of PwD, such as audio books, blue laser light, camera, computer, Internet, phone, radio, tablet/iPad, television, and videos.                              Considering the different technological functionalities for the management and adaptation of reminiscence sessions, informal caregivers have a moderate interest for the most part (median of 3 in 5 for each).             This apparent decrease in interest (compared to our previous survey) will be addressed in the follow-up interviews.             The actual performance of the reminiscence therapy has not proved to be statistically significant for any of the functionalities in question.                              Caregivers indicate that they are comfortable introducing personal content into a technological system, as long as the system guarantees maximum privacy and security.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Formal Caregivers               Following, we present our results regarding formal caregivers.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Sample Characteristics                       A total of 34 formal caregivers answered our survey.              They were mostly female (85%), younger than 50 y-o (64%), completed higher education (85%), and do not have any visual impairments (65%).             They take care of more than seven PwD (76%), and at least one of the PwD is in a severe state of dementia (74%).                          The majority of caregivers are familiar with technology: they use mobile phones daily, and computers/tablet/iPad six days a week.                              \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Reminiscence Therapy                       Formal caregivers perform reminiscence therapy sessions more often than the informal ones (68% vs 41%).             They usually conduct the sessions 3-4 (39%) or 5-10 (30%) times per month.             Sessions occur mainly at the institution (74%) but in the house of the PwD as well (35%), with an average duration of 30-60 minutes (65%) or less than 30 minutes (30%).                          Images (95%), music (87%), videos (57%), and text (48%) are used to stimulate memories, and are both personal (87%) and general (83%).                          Caregivers would like to use video (57%), text (48%), images (43%), music (39%), and other materials (such as objects, arts' material, games, daily activities, and visits to places of interest) more often.                          The materials used are related to places where the person lived (96%), PwD's relatives (87%), places PwD visited (83%), jobs of the PwD (78%), pets (70%), and vehicles they had (43%).             Caregivers also report that they like to use material related to other topics such as habits, hobbies, favorite food, musicians, television shows, movies and actors, important dates, past and present objects, sports, or plants.             Materials are obtained through the Internet (87%), or provided by PwD's relatives (74%), the PwD (57%), or friends (43%).             The material is updated in a monthly (26%), weekly (22%), daily or fortnightly (17% each) basis.             They do not update it more often due to lack of time (100%), lack of perceived usefulness for the PwD (50%), and lack of materials or need to repeat the same activities (25% each).                              Caregivers collect information about the emotional state of the PwD after sessions (87%), material that helped to recall past memories or elicited positive emotional reactions (83% each), material that elicited negative emotional reactions (70%), PwD's emotional state before sessions (65%), and duration of each session (48%).             Moreover, they also collect the degree of involvement and interest of PwD, level of communication, dynamics with caregiver or the group, PwD answers during the session, as well as periodic assessments of cognitive functions.                          Finally, they show interest in being able to collect the intensity level of emotional reactions (positive and negative) to specific stimuli, record permission for assessments, how the PwD was during the session (refusals, non-verbal language, behavior, relationship with therapist, initiative in contact), and in-session responses that might be relevant in future sessions.                      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Follow-up Medical Appointments                       Fifty-three percent of the formal caregivers conduct follow-up medical appointments with the PwD on a daily (28%) or weekly (28%) basis.             Caregivers report they do not conduct appointments more often because of the costs associated.                              The emotional well-being of the PwD is almost always evaluated at the appointments (93%), followed by the PwD's emotional reactions (87%), and the results from previous reminiscence sessions (67%).             Other follow-up activities with the PwD are conducted (49%), in particular, cognitive stimulation, movement sessions, sensory stimulation sessions, hygiene/food care, caregiver support with family members and joint sessions (PwD and family), psychotherapy, and games.                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities                           Sixty-five percent of caregivers already use technology to help them in the care of the PwD, in particular, the CogWeb application <cit.>, computer, images, music, mobile phones, overhead projector, snoezelen (multi sensory) room, tablet, and videos.                          They are interested in all the technological functionalities, in particular, they are very interested in those related to the adaptation and personalization of sessions.             Their interest is much higher than that of the informal caregivers, which we believe is due to the fact that most of the informal caregivers only take care of one person and do not need to manage several PwD at the same time.             Such difference in the interest across the type of caregivers is statistically significant for all functionalities:                          Management of PwD:         \\t             \\t   \\t       * Creating reminders ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Notifying other caregivers ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t   \\t       * Sharing care with others ( RPLUS MATCH )                          \\tReminiscence sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the biographical information of the PwD ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Automatically adapting the session content based on the emotional reactions of the PwD to the materials presented ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the materials used in each therapy session ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of caregiver's sessions ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Consulting the history of the PwD's sessions even if performed by others ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t             \\t            \\tMaterial used in the therapy sessions:         \\t             \\t           * Inserting new material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Inserting material topics ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Creating a favorites section in each patient's material ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t                 Help tools for the users:         \\t             \\t           * Email/Telephone ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Help within application ( RPLUS MATCH )         \\t           * Instructions manual (U=1231.00, p=.010\", \"statisticType\": \"mwutest\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \".010\", \"U\": \"1231.00\", \"r\": null, \"z\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality ( RPLUS MATCH ).

ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality ( RPLUS MATCH ).

In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality ( RPLUS MATCH ).

Subjective human ratings of the model explanations are commonly used as a direct approach for evaluating machine learning explanations by providing a numerical rating of explanations goodness using a simple quantitative measure such Likert scales.  However, subjective measures typically lack precision and may include user bias.

Although it is often glossed over, the registration process can play a vital role in forming the user's initial  perspective of the system.  In our experimental system the password condition was a simple password entry prompt in the traditional style (users were asked to enter the password twice to confirm it's correctness).  By comparison, since we had elected to allow users to design their own cueblots we implemented a cueblot designer as part of the registration process.  We found that this resulted in users spending considerable time designing their cueblot, inflating  the registration time (seconds) for the cueblot condition (M: 256.03, SE: 71.364) so that it was  much more time-consuming than  password registration time (M: 44.88, SE: 8.68), t(52) = -2.729, p < 0.05\", \"statisticType\": \"ttest_apa\", \"record\": {\"doF\": \"52\", \"pval\": \"0.05\", \"tstat\": \"-2.729\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.  Regarding the effectiveness of explanations, generally speaking, prior research has primarily focused on comparing individual explanation styles head-to-head (e.g., <cit.>), while little work has been done on evaluating the interplay of different styles, including potential complementarity.  <cit.> emphasize the sparsity of empirical work w.r.t. the effectiveness of explanations overall.        Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).  Overall, we find a significant effect between different conditions on perceptions of informational fairness (p < 0.001) as well as on perceptions of trustworthiness (p < 0.001).  A Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons shows that the effect for informational fairness is significant (p < 0.05) between all conditions except (Base) and (F).  The effect for trustworthiness is significant between (Base) and (FFI), (Base) and (FFICF), as well as (F) and (FFICF), and marginally significant between (F) and (FFI) (p = 0.052)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.052\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",
        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"This desideratum is closely linked to informational fairness of ADS <cit.>, as introduced earlier.  We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.  Regarding the effectiveness of explanations, generally speaking, prior research has primarily focused on comparing individual explanation styles head-to-head (e.g., <cit.>), while little work has been done on evaluating the interplay of different styles, including potential complementarity.  <cit.> emphasize the sparsity of empirical work w.r.t. the effectiveness of explanations overall.        Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.

Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.

Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).

We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.

Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.

Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.

We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.

While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.

Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).  Overall, we find a significant effect between different conditions on perceptions of informational fairness  RPLUS MATCH  as well as on perceptions of trustworthiness  RPLUS MATCH .  A Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons shows that the effect for informational fairness is significant (p < 0.05)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.05\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",
        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"Gender should be considered the least and credit history is most important.\\u201d)  One SP even suggested that \\u201cgender could play a part in the decision making, but not a big one so it's good as it is\\u201d (#751). (Recall that gender was ranked last in our explanation (see \\u00a0<ref>).)              Counterfactual scenarios 47% of coded responses indicated that the provided counterfactual scenarios are appropriate, e.g., endorsing that they \\u201care all financial and based on the ability of the loan to be paid back\\u201d (#448).  However, 20% questioned the effectiveness of adhering to some of the counterfactual recommendations; especially regarding suggested changes to co-applicant income or property area: \\u201cThese factors do not change the fact that an applicant can or can not pay his/her debt\\u201d (#454).  Actionability of counterfactual scenarios was another important theme: 9% overall addressed this, being appreciative that some counterfactual scenarios are explicitly actionable (#836: \\u201cChanging the loan term is possible immediately\\u201d) and disenchanted when not (#462: \\u201cSome hardly achivable [sic] scenarios must be met to ensure the bank [will] be repayed [sic].\\u201d)  Some themes were addressed by fewer SPs but are highly interesting: one SP was, e.g., confused by the \\u201cdirection\\u201d of suggested changes: \\u201cInstead of a short loan amount term, it could be a bit longer\\u201d (#778).  Others were seemingly distracted by suggested changes that are (too) small: \\u201cThe incomes are so close to the required that it shouldn't matter\\u201d (#447).  Finally, some SPs hinted at potential inconsistencies between individual explanations: \\u201cIt seems odd that loan amount term is placed so low when it was one of the areas the individual could change to obtain the loan\\u201d (#435).     \\u00a7 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS   In this section, we link our quantitative results to qualitative insights to get a better understanding as to why certain effects were observed, and we analyze and discuss in more detail the findings from the fitted SEM.  Finally, we allude to several implications of our work.        Connecting quantitative and qualitative findings As observed in Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), both perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness increase as more explanations are provided to SPs\\u2014however, INFF at a much higher rate than TRST.  Interestingly, many SPs in the (Base) condition, who do not receive any further explanations w.r.t. the inner workings of the ADS, do not find this \\u201cblack-box\\u201d system to be overly problematic w.r.t. informational fairness: as can be seen in Fig.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), SPs' responses for INFF are approx. equally distributed across ratings 1\\u20134.  This might be due to people's expectations; one SP simply stated that this \\u201cseems to be standard practice\\u201d (#1212) in terms of explaining ADS.  From Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>) we infer that providing relevant factors (F) to SPs does not significantly increase INFF.  A likely reason for this observation is that SPs asked for significant follow-up information w.r.t. how the factors are used for decision-making.  Both the differences for (F)\\u2192(FFI) and (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) are significant for INFF.  Considering the qualitative findings (\\u00a0<ref>), this seems little surprising as the complementary explanations (e.g., factor importance in (FFI) over (F)) were specifically requested by SPs.   While some explanations clearly helped SPs understand the given ADS better, they also reveal certain aspects that might be detrimental to people's trust.  Similar to INFF, one might have expected to see lower ratings for TRST in the (Base) condition.  Instead, SPs' responses for TRST are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 3 (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, \\u00a0<ref>).  Regarding marginal effects of explanations on TRST, we note that none of (Base)\\u2192(F), (F)\\u2192(FFI), or (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) lead to statistically significant changes in SPs' perceptions.  As for (Base)\\u2192(F), SPs' trust appears to be hampered by the experience that certain (presumably) inappropriate factors (e.g., gender) are being considered by the ADS.  While the change (F)\\u2192(FFI) is marginally significant (p = 0.052)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.052\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

We then explain that the company rejected a given individual\\u2019s loan application.  Afterwards, we randomly allocate study participants to one of two conditions: 50% of participants are provided the information that an ADS made the decision, and the other 50% are told that the decision-maker was a human being.  We then provide identical explanations regarding a decision to study participants in either condition, the exact specifications of which will be derived and explained in more detail shortly.  Finally, we measure perceptions of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST) through multiple measurement items, drawn (and partially adapted) from previous studies (INFF: Colquitt et al. <cit.>; TRST: Carter and B\\u00e9langer <cit.>, Chiu et al. <cit.>, Lee <cit.>).  Additionally, we measure AI literacy (AILIT) of study participants, with items partially derived from Long and Magerko <cit.> as well as Wilkinson et al. <cit.>.       Data and ADS We design and implement a functional ADS for our study\\u2014similarly to earlier work by the authors <cit.>.  The ADS consists of an ML model that predicts loan approval on unseen data and can output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset[<https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset> (last accessed: August 24, 2021)] on home loan application decisions, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on the platform .[ is the world\\u2019s largest data science community (<https://www.kaggle.com/>)]  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations.  It includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might, in practice, be used to train ADS <cit.>.  After removing data points with missing values, we are left with 480 observations, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  As it is common in ML-based applications, we use 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  As groundwork for the design of our ADS, after encoding and scaling the features, we train a random forest classifier <cit.>.  The classifier is then able to predict the (unseen) held-out labels\\u2014which it achieves with an out-of-bag accuracy of 80.1%.  We use this classifier as a basis for the scenarios and explanations that participants are confronted with.       Explanations Recall that 50% of study participants are assigned the ADS condition and 50% the human condition.  Both conditions are provided with identical explanations regarding the decisions\\u2014the only difference is that study participants in the ADS condition are told that the ADS provides the explanatory information.  In contrast, participants in the human condition are told that a company representative (i.e., a human) provides this information.  We now explain in more detail the provided explanations.  As noted earlier, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided by humans and ADS alike.  First, we disclose all features (applicant income, co-applicant income, etc., as mentioned earlier), including corresponding values (e.g., applicant income: $3,069 per month) for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our ADS denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ different settings to ensure generalizability.  We also explain to study participants the importance of these features in the decision-making process.  For that, we compute permutation feature importances <cit.> from our model and obtain the following hierarchy, ordered from most to least important: credit history > loan amount > applicant income > co-applicant income > property area > marital status > dependents > education > loan amount term > self-employment > gender.  Note that feature importance is a global explanation style, meaning that this ordered list will be identical for any setting (i.e., applicant).  For each setting, we finally provide three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable feature each is minimally altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection (e.g., the individual would have been granted the loan if, everything else unchanged, the co-applicant income had been at least $800 per month).  To ascertain which of the features are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them to increase their chances of being granted a loan\\u2014we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable features are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  We finally provide counterfactual explanations for a random subset of three of these features per setting.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection  We conducted a between-subjects online study to test our hypotheses.  Participants for this study were recruited via [ is an online platform for recruiting high-quality research participants.] <cit.> and randomly assigned to either the human decision scenario or the ADS decision scenario.  Every participant was provided with two questionnaires associated with two different settings.  In each questionnaire, we asked participants to rate their agreement with multiple statements per construct on 5-point Likert scales <cit.>.  A score of 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and a score of 5 to \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  To be able to understand participants\\u2019 quantitative responses better, we included multiple open-ended questions as well.  We had to eliminate 4 of the 200 collected responses due to failure to pass an attention check\\u2014therefore, we analyzed 196 responses.  Among our participants, 62% were male, 36% female, and the remaining 2% referred to themselves as non-binary or did not disclose their gender at all; 42% were students, 29% employed full-time, 11% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 10% unemployed, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The average age of participants was 26.4 years.        \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS  Before conducting our tests, we assess the validity and reliability of our latent constructs (INFF, TRST, AILIT), each of which is measured through multiple items.  We note that average variance extracted (AVE) is above or equal to the recommended threshold of 0.5 for INFF and TRST, while the AVE of AILIT is 0.39.  According to Fornell and Larcker <cit.>, if the AVE value of a construct is low, its convergent validity can still be sufficient if composite reliability (CR) is above 0.6.  The CR of all our three constructs, INFF (0.83), TRST (0.94), and AILIT (0.72) is, in fact, above the threshold of 0.7, which is recommended by Barclay et al. <cit.>.  Therefore, our convergent validity is sufficient for AILIT as well.  Values for Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (CA) are larger than the recommended threshold of 0.7 for our three constructs, indicating good reliability <cit.>.  Validity and reliability measures are summarized in Table <ref>.           \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Comparison of perceptions  We conduct two Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.> to examine the differences in perceptions between ADS and human decision-makers.

We note that average variance extracted (AVE) is above or equal to the recommended threshold of 0.5 for INFF and TRST, while the AVE of AILIT is 0.39.  According to Fornell and Larcker <cit.>, if the AVE value of a construct is low, its convergent validity can still be sufficient if composite reliability (CR) is above 0.6.  The CR of all our three constructs, INFF (0.83), TRST (0.94), and AILIT (0.72) is, in fact, above the threshold of 0.7, which is recommended by Barclay et al. <cit.>.  Therefore, our convergent validity is sufficient for AILIT as well.  Values for Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (CA) are larger than the recommended threshold of 0.7 for our three constructs, indicating good reliability <cit.>.  Validity and reliability measures are summarized in Table <ref>.           \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Comparison of perceptions  We conduct two Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.> to examine the differences in perceptions between ADS and human decision-makers.  The Mann-Whitney U test for informational fairness is statistically significant  RPLUS MATCH , suggesting a significant difference between participants\\u2019 perceptions of informational fairness.  Comparing the means of perceptions of informational fairness for both conditions reveals that the ADS condition (M=3.68) is perceived to be significantly fairer than the human condition (M=3.47).  For perceptions of trustworthiness, however, there is no significant difference between the conditions (p=0.113)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.113\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Specifically, we confront study participants with situations where a person was denied a loan.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  According to, e.g., Atico <cit.>, this is also an area where ADS are commonly employed for high-stakes decision-making.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design       Overall setup We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: First, we reveal to study participants some basic information about the lending company\\u2014similarly to the study setup introduced in our earlier work <cit.>.  We then explain that the company rejected a given individual\\u2019s loan application.  Afterwards, we randomly allocate study participants to one of two conditions: 50% of participants are provided the information that an ADS made the decision, and the other 50% are told that the decision-maker was a human being.  We then provide identical explanations regarding a decision to study participants in either condition, the exact specifications of which will be derived and explained in more detail shortly.  Finally, we measure perceptions of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST) through multiple measurement items, drawn (and partially adapted) from previous studies (INFF: Colquitt et al. <cit.>; TRST: Carter and B\\u00e9langer <cit.>, Chiu et al. <cit.>, Lee <cit.>).  Additionally, we measure AI literacy (AILIT) of study participants, with items partially derived from Long and Magerko <cit.> as well as Wilkinson et al. <cit.>.       Data and ADS We design and implement a functional ADS for our study\\u2014similarly to earlier work by the authors <cit.>.  The ADS consists of an ML model that predicts loan approval on unseen data and can output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset[<https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset> (last accessed: August 24, 2021)] on home loan application decisions, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on the platform .[ is the world\\u2019s largest data science community (<https://www.kaggle.com/>)]  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations.  It includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might, in practice, be used to train ADS <cit.>.  After removing data points with missing values, we are left with 480 observations, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  As it is common in ML-based applications, we use 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  As groundwork for the design of our ADS, after encoding and scaling the features, we train a random forest classifier <cit.>.  The classifier is then able to predict the (unseen) held-out labels\\u2014which it achieves with an out-of-bag accuracy of 80.1%.  We use this classifier as a basis for the scenarios and explanations that participants are confronted with.       Explanations Recall that 50% of study participants are assigned the ADS condition and 50% the human condition.  Both conditions are provided with identical explanations regarding the decisions\\u2014the only difference is that study participants in the ADS condition are told that the ADS provides the explanatory information.  In contrast, participants in the human condition are told that a company representative (i.e., a human) provides this information.  We now explain in more detail the provided explanations.  As noted earlier, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided by humans and ADS alike.  First, we disclose all features (applicant income, co-applicant income, etc., as mentioned earlier), including corresponding values (e.g., applicant income: $3,069 per month) for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our ADS denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ different settings to ensure generalizability.  We also explain to study participants the importance of these features in the decision-making process.  For that, we compute permutation feature importances <cit.> from our model and obtain the following hierarchy, ordered from most to least important: credit history > loan amount > applicant income > co-applicant income > property area > marital status > dependents > education > loan amount term > self-employment > gender.  Note that feature importance is a global explanation style, meaning that this ordered list will be identical for any setting (i.e., applicant).  For each setting, we finally provide three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable feature each is minimally altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection (e.g., the individual would have been granted the loan if, everything else unchanged, the co-applicant income had been at least $800 per month).  To ascertain which of the features are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them to increase their chances of being granted a loan\\u2014we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable features are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  We finally provide counterfactual explanations for a random subset of three of these features per setting.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection  We conducted a between-subjects online study to test our hypotheses.  Participants for this study were recruited via [ is an online platform for recruiting high-quality research participants.] <cit.> and randomly assigned to either the human decision scenario or the ADS decision scenario.  Every participant was provided with two questionnaires associated with two different settings.  In each questionnaire, we asked participants to rate their agreement with multiple statements per construct on 5-point Likert scales <cit.>.  A score of 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and a score of 5 to \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  To be able to understand participants\\u2019 quantitative responses better, we included multiple open-ended questions as well.  We had to eliminate 4 of the 200 collected responses due to failure to pass an attention check\\u2014therefore, we analyzed 196 responses.  Among our participants, 62% were male, 36% female, and the remaining 2% referred to themselves as non-binary or did not disclose their gender at all; 42% were students, 29% employed full-time, 11% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 10% unemployed, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.

For perceptions of trustworthiness, however, there is no significant difference between the conditions  RPLUS MATCH .  Hence, neither H1 nor H2 are supported by our analyses.  In fact, H1 is reversely supported, eventually suggesting that for our study setup, informational fairness perceptions tend to be higher towards the ADS compared to the human decision-maker.  Based on qualitative responses from study participants, we conjecture that this might be due to the perceived absence of emotions and subjectivity in automation.  Other potential reasons for this based on qualitative feedback are given in Section <ref>.  Note that this finding seems contradictory to some prior works\\u2019 results (e.g., Castelo et al. <cit.>), which raises doubts about the generalizability of such findings beyond specific domains.  Interestingly, when considering people\\u2019s AI literacy, these results change.  For this analysis, we split our data into two (approximately equal-sized) sub-samples along the median value of AI literacy.  We refer to one sample as high AI literacy participants and the other as low AI literacy participants.  We then conduct separate Mann-Whitney U tests for the two sub-samples.

Participants with high AI literacy perceive the ADS as significantly more informationally fair  RPLUS MATCH  and more trustworthy  RPLUS MATCH  than the human decision-maker.  For participants with low AI literacy, we do not find a significant difference for perceptions of informational fairness (p=0.312)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.312\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",
        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"ADS) on people\\u2019s perceptions of trustworthiness.         \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We evaluate our hypotheses in the context of lending\\u2014an example of a provider-customer encounter.  Specifically, we confront study participants with situations where a person was denied a loan.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  According to, e.g., Atico <cit.>, this is also an area where ADS are commonly employed for high-stakes decision-making.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design       Overall setup We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: First, we reveal to study participants some basic information about the lending company\\u2014similarly to the study setup introduced in our earlier work <cit.>.  We then explain that the company rejected a given individual\\u2019s loan application.  Afterwards, we randomly allocate study participants to one of two conditions: 50% of participants are provided the information that an ADS made the decision, and the other 50% are told that the decision-maker was a human being.  We then provide identical explanations regarding a decision to study participants in either condition, the exact specifications of which will be derived and explained in more detail shortly.  Finally, we measure perceptions of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST) through multiple measurement items, drawn (and partially adapted) from previous studies (INFF: Colquitt et al. <cit.>; TRST: Carter and B\\u00e9langer <cit.>, Chiu et al. <cit.>, Lee <cit.>).  Additionally, we measure AI literacy (AILIT) of study participants, with items partially derived from Long and Magerko <cit.> as well as Wilkinson et al. <cit.>.       Data and ADS We design and implement a functional ADS for our study\\u2014similarly to earlier work by the authors <cit.>.  The ADS consists of an ML model that predicts loan approval on unseen data and can output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset[<https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset> (last accessed: August 24, 2021)] on home loan application decisions, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on the platform .[ is the world\\u2019s largest data science community (<https://www.kaggle.com/>)]  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations.  It includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might, in practice, be used to train ADS <cit.>.  After removing data points with missing values, we are left with 480 observations, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  As it is common in ML-based applications, we use 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  As groundwork for the design of our ADS, after encoding and scaling the features, we train a random forest classifier <cit.>.  The classifier is then able to predict the (unseen) held-out labels\\u2014which it achieves with an out-of-bag accuracy of 80.1%.  We use this classifier as a basis for the scenarios and explanations that participants are confronted with.       Explanations Recall that 50% of study participants are assigned the ADS condition and 50% the human condition.  Both conditions are provided with identical explanations regarding the decisions\\u2014the only difference is that study participants in the ADS condition are told that the ADS provides the explanatory information.  In contrast, participants in the human condition are told that a company representative (i.e., a human) provides this information.  We now explain in more detail the provided explanations.  As noted earlier, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided by humans and ADS alike.  First, we disclose all features (applicant income, co-applicant income, etc., as mentioned earlier), including corresponding values (e.g., applicant income: $3,069 per month) for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our ADS denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ different settings to ensure generalizability.  We also explain to study participants the importance of these features in the decision-making process.  For that, we compute permutation feature importances <cit.> from our model and obtain the following hierarchy, ordered from most to least important: credit history > loan amount > applicant income > co-applicant income > property area > marital status > dependents > education > loan amount term > self-employment > gender.  Note that feature importance is a global explanation style, meaning that this ordered list will be identical for any setting (i.e., applicant).  For each setting, we finally provide three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable feature each is minimally altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection (e.g., the individual would have been granted the loan if, everything else unchanged, the co-applicant income had been at least $800 per month).  To ascertain which of the features are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them to increase their chances of being granted a loan\\u2014we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable features are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  We finally provide counterfactual explanations for a random subset of three of these features per setting.         \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection  We conducted a between-subjects online study to test our hypotheses.  Participants for this study were recruited via [ is an online platform for recruiting high-quality research participants.] <cit.> and randomly assigned to either the human decision scenario or the ADS decision scenario.  Every participant was provided with two questionnaires associated with two different settings.  In each questionnaire, we asked participants to rate their agreement with multiple statements per construct on 5-point Likert scales <cit.>.  A score of 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and a score of 5 to \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  To be able to understand participants\\u2019 quantitative responses better, we included multiple open-ended questions as well.  We had to eliminate 4 of the 200 collected responses due to failure to pass an attention check\\u2014therefore, we analyzed 196 responses.  Among our participants, 62% were male, 36% female, and the remaining 2% referred to themselves as non-binary or did not disclose their gender at all; 42% were students, 29% employed full-time, 11% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 10% unemployed, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The average age of participants was 26.4 years.        \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS  Before conducting our tests, we assess the validity and reliability of our latent constructs (INFF, TRST, AILIT), each of which is measured through multiple items.  We note that average variance extracted (AVE) is above or equal to the recommended threshold of 0.5 for INFF and TRST, while the AVE of AILIT is 0.39.  According to Fornell and Larcker <cit.>, if the AVE value of a construct is low, its convergent validity can still be sufficient if composite reliability (CR) is above 0.6.  The CR of all our three constructs, INFF (0.83), TRST (0.94), and AILIT (0.72) is, in fact, above the threshold of 0.7, which is recommended by Barclay et al. <cit.>.  Therefore, our convergent validity is sufficient for AILIT as well.  Values for Cronbach\\u2019s alpha (CA) are larger than the recommended threshold of 0.7 for our three constructs, indicating good reliability <cit.>.  Validity and reliability measures are summarized in Table <ref>.           \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Comparison of perceptions  We conduct two Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.> to examine the differences in perceptions between ADS and human decision-makers.  The Mann-Whitney U test for informational fairness is statistically significant  RPLUS MATCH , suggesting a significant difference between participants\\u2019 perceptions of informational fairness.  Comparing the means of perceptions of informational fairness for both conditions reveals that the ADS condition (M=3.68) is perceived to be significantly fairer than the human condition (M=3.47).  For perceptions of trustworthiness, however, there is no significant difference between the conditions  RPLUS MATCH .  Hence, neither H1 nor H2 are supported by our analyses.  In fact, H1 is reversely supported, eventually suggesting that for our study setup, informational fairness perceptions tend to be higher towards the ADS compared to the human decision-maker.  Based on qualitative responses from study participants, we conjecture that this might be due to the perceived absence of emotions and subjectivity in automation.  Other potential reasons for this based on qualitative feedback are given in Section <ref>.  Note that this finding seems contradictory to some prior works\\u2019 results (e.g., Castelo et al. <cit.>), which raises doubts about the generalizability of such findings beyond specific domains.  Interestingly, when considering people\\u2019s AI literacy, these results change.  For this analysis, we split our data into two (approximately equal-sized) sub-samples along the median value of AI literacy.  We refer to one sample as high AI literacy participants and the other as low AI literacy participants.  We then conduct separate Mann-Whitney U tests for the two sub-samples.  Participants with high AI literacy perceive the ADS as significantly more informationally fair  RPLUS MATCH  and more trustworthy  RPLUS MATCH  than the human decision-maker.  For participants with low AI literacy, we do not find a significant difference for perceptions of informational fairness  RPLUS MATCH  or trustworthiness (p=0.995)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.995\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Thus, these results only support [H2] partially, as although the Free task (the less constrained task) consistently obtained the lowest FoC ratings (except for the W100), this effect was not visible between Target and Trajectory tasks.       As the ANOVA analysis indicated that the strongest effects originated from the Weight factor, to further characterize the relationship between FoC and the Weight factor, a linear regression analysis was conducted across participants for each task (Figure <ref> right).  The regression equations were   Free:  y    = 0.0487x + 1.77 (R^2=0.83)   Target:  y    = 0.0379x + 2.94 (R^2=0.65)   Trajectory:  y    = 0.0444x + 2.49 (R^2=0.73).   The regression equations exhibited linear positive correlations between the FoC and the Weight.

In addition, owing to the different natures of each task (aimed movement, path following task), we did not assess the differences among Tasks for the task completion time.  Therefore, we conducted three Friedman tests considering Weight group as a factor, one for each task.  The Friedman tests exhibited significant differences among the task completion times of the Weight groups only for  the Free task (\\u03c7^2=14, p < .001), and no significant differences were found for the Target task (\\u03c7^2=0.17, p = .92) or the Trajectory task: (\\u03c7^2=3.5, p = .17).

H3: Participants who used both exploration metrics and suggestions were confident in their decisions.  To understand how exploration metrics and bias mitigating suggestions impact participants' decision-making process, we asked each participant how confident they were about reading enough reviews and making the right decision in the post-study questionnaire (See Figure\\u00a0<ref>).  76% of the participants (19/25) in condition M&S were highly or completely confident that they had read enough reviews.    Furthermore, 64% of the participants (16/25) in condition M&S and 76% of the participants (19/25) in condition S were also highly or completely confident that they had made the right decision.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method (F(2, 34) = 5.55, p = 0.008\", \"statisticType\": \"anova_apa_no_r\", \"record\": {\"Fval\": \"5.55\", \"pval\": \"0.008\", \"doF\": \"34\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).

Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.

However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The ranking of E_v was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tThe assumption of sphericity was satisfied \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.24, p = 0.538). \\tGuidance method had significant effects ( RPLUS MATCH ), and the post-hoc test showed that \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tThe ranking of \\u03a9_a was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6  < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 3.15, p = 0.207). \\tGuidance method was significant ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to Tukey's test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2.  \\tIn summary, \\ud835\\udda6 exhibited better performance than \\ud835\\uddad in terms of E_\\u03b4 but worse performance in \\u03a9_a. \\tBetween \\ud835\\udda2 and \\ud835\\uddad, \\ud835\\udda2 showed better performance in E_\\u03b4 and E_v but worse performance in E_d and \\u03a9_a. \\tComparing the two guidance methods, \\ud835\\udda2 achieved better performance than \\ud835\\udda6 in E_\\u03b4 \\tNo other combinations showed significant differences.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

Driving Behavior Performance      The behavioral measures (SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, ARR_2^\\u2218, and TLC_<1) of human factors in driving were calculated for each driving trajectory.     The means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>c.  \\tThe ranking of SRR_1^\\u2218 was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 6.06, p = 0.048).

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

Driving Behavior Performance      The behavioral measures (SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, ARR_2^\\u2218, and TLC_<1) of human factors in driving were calculated for each driving trajectory.     The means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>c.  \\tThe ranking of SRR_1^\\u2218 was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 6.06, p = 0.048).

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

Driving Behavior Performance      The behavioral measures (SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, ARR_2^\\u2218, and TLC_<1) of human factors in driving were calculated for each driving trajectory.     The means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>c.  \\tThe ranking of SRR_1^\\u2218 was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 6.06, p = 0.048).

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.

In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The ranking of E_v was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tThe assumption of sphericity was satisfied \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.24, p = 0.538). \\tGuidance method had significant effects ( RPLUS MATCH ), and the post-hoc test showed that \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tThe ranking of \\u03a9_a was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6  < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 3.15, p = 0.207). \\tGuidance method was significant ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to Tukey's test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2.  \\tIn summary, \\ud835\\udda6 exhibited better performance than \\ud835\\uddad in terms of E_\\u03b4 but worse performance in \\u03a9_a. \\tBetween \\ud835\\udda2 and \\ud835\\uddad, \\ud835\\udda2 showed better performance in E_\\u03b4 and E_v but worse performance in E_d and \\u03a9_a. \\tComparing the two guidance methods, \\ud835\\udda2 achieved better performance than \\ud835\\udda6 in E_\\u03b4 \\tNo other combinations showed significant differences.    Driving Behavior Performance      The behavioral measures (SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, ARR_2^\\u2218, and TLC_<1) of human factors in driving were calculated for each driving trajectory.     The means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>c.  \\tThe ranking of SRR_1^\\u2218 was \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 6.06, p = 0.048).

In the post-hoc test,         \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad     and \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad     were shown to be statistically significant.      The ranking of ARR_0.25^\\u2218 was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.72, p = 0.423). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ),     and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6. \\tThe rankings of ARR_1^\\u2218 and ARR_2^\\u2218 were also         \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6. \\tBoth satisfied the assumption of sphericity \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 3.54, p = 0.171 and \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.79, p = 0.408), \\tbut there existed no significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH  and  RPLUS MATCH ).      In TLC_<1, the ranking was     \\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.419).     There existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ),     and the post-hoc test showed that \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.      In summary, both \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 showed better performance in all SRR metrics, SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218.     However, \\ud835\\udda6 showed the best performance in SRR_1^\\u2218, whereas \\ud835\\udda2 showed the best performance in SRR_4^\\u2218 and SRR_8^\\u2218, all with statistically significant differences.     The ARR metrics showed that \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 were not efficient.     In particular, the results of ARR_0.25^\\u2218 demonstrated that \\ud835\\udda6 significantly degrades the pedaling performance of \\ud835\\uddad.     Both \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 showed that they could significantly help drivers drive safely with increased TLC_<1.     This effect was more significant in \\ud835\\udda2 than in \\ud835\\udda6.    Qualitative Results      We computed the mean scores for each subjective question (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>d).     For the steering wheel, the ranking of effectiveness score was         \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2.     The assumption of sphericity was violated         (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 10.87, p = 0.004),     and the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.67) was applied.     Significant differences were observed         (F(1.34, 22.77) = 22.53, p < 0.001)     and according to the post-hoc test,         \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6     and         \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.     For comfort, the ranking was         \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6,     and the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 0.09, p = 0.957).
