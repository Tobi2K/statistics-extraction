In their work, logging can be done via audio, in addition to logging with tags during the review of the footage.  3.2  Interaction with automation  In this section, the mode of interaction as well as the level of video abstractions [Truong and Venkatesh] will be summarized
Note that many ingame events are handled at the local latency, without game server intervention.  1.1  Local System Latency  In computing systems, there are many types of latency that contribute to the total time it takes for a user’s actions to produce output from the system

Finally, we want to include an evaluation framework for analysing system performance in relation to 1) qualitative properties of the interaction, 2) goals and intentions following a reinforcement learning approach and 3) by evaluating the resulting eKG.  7  Acknowledgements  This research was funded by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) via the Spinoza grant (SPI 63-260) awarded to Piek Vossen, the Hybrid Intelligence Centre via the Zwaartekracht grant (024.004.022) and the research project (9406
The importance for data representation lies in that perceived changes between colors can be mapped intuitively in a linear fashion to the changes in data they represent.  3   CIELAB  sRGB  L* = 100  B=1  G=1 -a*  -a*  (0,0,0) +b*  -b*  R=1  L* = 0  Figure 2: The (left) CIELAB and (right) sRGB color space axes and their hues
F0 is the pullback force which is null if the string is pulled out (i.e. if q̇ >= 0) and large enough to overcome the friction in the Bowden cable and pull the string back on the pulley if the string is released (i.e. if q̇ < 0)

In order to eventually replace paper with devices, designers of new technology will have to successfully emulate these qualities.  1.  INTRODUCTION  In order to consider diverse opinions, it was important to find participants who use devices and paper frequently and heavily
The RGI Elements in the Study  2.1  The RGI Elements  As we want to cover a broad range of different types of math search interfaces we opted for a set of 17 mSIs as RGI elements – ranging from standard mSIs like 3   “Zentralblatt Mathematik (zbMath)” or “MathSciNet” via social media platforms like “mathoverflow” to scientific prototypes like the “MSC map” interface (MSC = Math Subject Classification, see [17])

Since data science projects are often run across groups or companies,  3.2
Users could thus observe the same shared avatar, the movements of which, computed by inverse kinematics, would follow more or less their own hand according to their level of control at a certain time.  4  E XPERIMENT  4.1  Experiment Summary  We conducted an experiment, in which we explored the influence of the degree of control of an avatar shared with another person on one’s own SoA
The sequence length varies among different observations.  5   2.1  Action prediction model  To begin with, we describe a predictive model for future actions that forms a basic building block of the process segmentation method
The basic structure of ordered logit model or threshold models for a set of ordinal responses, r1 < r2 < · · · < rk can be mathematically represented as follows: Un∗ = βxn + εn  Un = rk  if  δk−1 < Un∗ < δk  (1)  for k = 1, 2, ..
This was crucial to our dialogue management system, as it provided the central triggering mechanism as to when the agent should start or cease a socially contingent conversational turn.  2  [38], where learning a new signed language quickly can be challenging

Thus, we leave consideration of the ways in which design of a coherent experience might affect specific choices of techniques to future work, and here focus on some specific techniques and their differences to what we might call “established practice.” 2.1  Narrow Interpretation of 3DUI  A key observation is that, while there are a variety of consumer VR systems, they form a rather narrow subset of what has previously been considered within the scope of 3DUI [1]
The tool allows developers to establish correspondences between system behaviours and tasks, and perform automated system testing by means of coexecution [5].  2.2  PVSio-web  PVSio-web is a toolkit for model-based development of user interface software

Finally, with the intent of being able to have a single contiguous sequence representing the bi-dimensional data instead of two disjoint sequences, we merged the two pitch φx and roll φy sequences corresponding to a sequence s into a flattened sequence sf by performing the following operation: sfi = sfi−1 ⊕ (φxi ⊕ φyi ) In other words, we concatenated the individual values of pitch and roll corresponding to the same position and then concatenated these merged values.   4  ELMAR H

While our network model does not require joint probability depiction, other probabilistic networks can (e.g., [40]). 2.2  Graph Visualization and Animation  Many network properties (e.g., centrality, clustering, density) have visual signatures, which make network visualization an important tool for network analysis
There are constant transitions between co-located and remote as well as synchronous and asynchronous collaboration; (2.) The team size S is greater than just two collaborators and multiple coupling styles can coexist simultaneously within a single team, effectively dividing the whole team in multiple temporary subgroups with each one having a size of 1 ≤ 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑏 ≤ 𝑆 and an individual coupling style; (3.) Users typically do not rely on a single groupware application or hardware device but simultaneously use different tools and devices during collaboration.” , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article

In contrast, the common dividend sharing approach would at times lock up a considerable amount of unused resources.  To define Pi , we assume an exponential relation between Pi and wi : ( !) sen Ni,succ 1 2 P − hP − wi −1 Pi := exp sen h2P j Nj,succ  (3)  sen where Nj,succ is the number of ‘accepted’ service requests from tenant j over  a sensing time interval ∆tsen (which is shorter that the time interval set to update the wj values) prior to the current time t, and hP is a bandwidth associated to the DoR process

Using the inverse discrete-time Fourier transform from the PSD the correlation sequence can be derived as following: Z π Z fs /2 Rxx = Pxx (ω) e−jωm dω = Pxx (f ) ej2πf /fs df −π  −fs /2  (2) The average power of the sequence xn over the entire Nyquist interval is represented by Z π Z fs /2 Rxx (0) = Pxx (ω) dω = Pxx (f ) df (3) −π  −fs /2  For a particular frequency band [ω 1 , ω 2 ], (0 ≤ ω1 ≤ ω2 ≤ π), the average power of a signal is given by: Z ω2 P[ω1 ,ω1 ] = Pxx (ω) dω (4) ω1  It can be seen from the above expression that Pxx (w) represents the power content of a signal in an extremely small frequency band, which is why it is known as the power spectral density
