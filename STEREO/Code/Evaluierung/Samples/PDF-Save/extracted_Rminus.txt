Keywords: Augmented reality, Head-mounted displays, Optical see-through, Human factors  1  Introduction  Augmented reality (AR) surgical guidance was originally proposed in neurosurgery over 35 years ago (Kelly et al., 1982; Roberts et al., 1986)In addition, for a custom calculator keyboard application, it can achieve 100% detection accuracyIn the literature, EDA has most often been taken as a measure of arousal [Bradley, 2000]Therefore, Sung proposed a development framework for such games in his research, so as to reduce the difficulty of developing games [8]XXXXXXX 1   ProcBefore entering in detail into the pilot study description, in following subsections we will describe in more depth what a stroke is and what are its consequences, and why a ’virtual’ approach could be useful for such a rehabilitation. 1.1Several studies using a picture-viewing paradigm have shown that EDA is highly correlated with self-reported emotional arousal [Lang et al., 1993]Request permissions from permissions@acm.org. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)Finally, two integer symbols a and b, two sets of integers symbols s1 and s2, and a goal are givenBecause of these impairments stroke sufferers are often unable 2   to independently perform day-to-day activities such as bathing, dressing, and eatingThe development of commercial optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) including Google Glass, Moverio and the HoloLens have led to an increasing interest in such devices for surgical guidance (see Fig. 1)Interact., 2022, November 12–16, 2022, Taipei, Taiwan  Robertson, Nguyen, and Salehi  cost, digital literacy, and trust in online platforms make it difficult to build technology that effectively promotes more equitable access to resources [29]Usually, clinicians will use some questionnaires, statistical manuals or structured interviews to assess the daily behavior of patients, so as to de-   2  termine whether they have ADHD [9]Manuscript submitted to ACM 1   IUI ’21, April 14–17, 2021, College Station, TX, USA  Eiband, Buschek and Hussmann  Fig. 1Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65Therefore: (1)  The magnetic field measured by the phone’s magnetometer, Bp , can be obtained from BT while taking into account the phone’s three rotation angles: yaw (ψ), pitch (θ) and roll (φ): Bp = Rx (φ)Ry (θ)Rz(ψ)BT  Bp = SRx (φ)Ry (θ)Rz(ψ)BT + H  (3)  Where the hard-iron effect H is an offset vector and the soft-iron effect S is a matrixIt is made of two parts: the hypotheses a = b + 1 and s2 = add(b,s1), and the conclusion mem(a - 1, add(b,si)) we would like to prove validSixteen recording sites were explored and compared in a review by van Dooren et al. [2012], which profiled site-wise responsiveness to emotional inducement (by film clips)In a number of districts including New York City, San Francisco, and Oakland, schools remain segregated and unequal, even with concerted effort and resources committed to maintaining and improving enrollment systems [19, 35, 78]While there is occasional critical analysis (Carbone et al., 2020), the majority of authors tend to emphasise the great potential of AR in surgical applicationsSerious games can improve the user’s participation in the evaluation process through immersive environment, interactive technology and multi-sensory experience to make the evaluation results more effective [10]For instance, work on interpretability has recently been criticised for unclear use of the term [29, 72], a survey on explainability in recommenders found incompatible existing taxonomies [77], and discussions about system transparency and accountability revealed diverging assumptions (i.e. disclosing source code vs system auditing through experts) [32]They may need frequent instruction and feedback to complete tasks (information from the National Stroke Association, 2010)Research has shown that one source of these challenges is unequal access to information about the available schools due to time and resource constraints [5, 43, 59, 69]Therefore, for the remainder of the paper, we focus on handling the components of Equation 2 so that MagBoard can work independently of the phone or magnet used, and regardless of the phone orientationThe purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of current research in OST-AR in surgery and examine Corresponding author email: manuel.birlo.18@ucl.ac.uk  possible barriers to clinical adoption of such devicesFor this reason each stroke rehabilitation program is personal, designed for a particular patient, and not a generic one. 1.2Gamified evaluation is more attractive than traditional evaluation, so that participants can complete the evaluation process without expending more energy, and it is possible to reduce the dropout rate during the evaluation process [11]Picard’s Multiple Arousal Theory Picard et al. [2015] suggests an explanation: that different brain areas map to different areas of the body, both contralaterally and ipsilaterallyA recent HCI survey shows the fractured terminological landscape in the field [1]Acknowledged features are among others: (i) the motivation of the participant; (ii) the use of variable practice (i.e. practice a variety of related  3   tasks); (iii) training with high intensity/many repetitions; (iv) and providing feedback (Krakauer, 2006; Levin et al., 2010; Langhorne et al., 2009)Oakland Unified School District district serves over 50,000 students, of whom 90% are students of color, and 72% are from low-income families [1]System Overview and Scenario  TABLE I: Notations used in the paper.

In all modes of operation, the Offset Compensator module removes noise and environmental effects, which makes the system independent from the phone orientation and magnet polarityVideo games can provide an immersive game environment, provide users with fascinating game challenges, and greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of players [15]In VST systems, a video image feed is combined with superimposed computer generated images such as 3D re-   2  Utility of Optical See-Through Head Mounted Displays in Augmented Reality-Assisted Surgery  constructed organsIn this paper, we thus aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Which assumptions about users and interaction with intelligent systems do researchers make when referring to the system qualities? RQ2: How can we structure and differentiate these assumptions? 2  CONTRIBUTION AND SUMMARY  We analyse both theoretical concepts and prototype solutions through the lens of implied user questions and synthesise a conceptual framework integrating user mindsets, user involvement and knowledge outcomes to reveal, differentiate and classify notions of supporting user understanding of intelligent systems in prior workIn particular, research in animal models suggests that with intensive therapy (repeating individual motions hundreds of times per day), animals that experience strokes can recover a significant amount of their lost motor control (Selzer et al., 2006)Indeed, Backs and Boucsein (p. 6) argued that this might be more appropriate for investigating the specific sensitivity of physiological effects in HCIOffline Calibration  3  Keyboard Designer  Fig. 2: MagBoard architectureIts main operations are guessing truth values of (immediate) sub-formulas appearing in disjunctions (decision) and propagating unit facts that have been deduced (bcp). 1 Type variables, if any, are prenex and implicitly universally quantified. 2 this notion is crucial to control how axioms are instantiated, and is explained at the end of this section   4  AltGr-Ergo  problem .why  AST  Frontend  GUI (AltGr-Ergo)  Feedback axioms  Axioms instances  model?

Structuring the Discussion  IUI ’21, April 14–17, 2021, College Station, TX, USA  (2) User involvement – how users gain knowledge (e.g. do they actively inquire into the system or do they get presented information by it), and (3) Knowledge outcomes – what kind of knowledge users gain (e.g. about a specific output or how to correct errors)The disadvantages of VST systems include limitations in terms of video bandwidth, the risk of losing vision of the real scene in the case of system errors and geometric aberrations such as distorted spatial perception (Cutolo et al., 2018)Viewing parent advocates’ practices and relationships as assets, an assets-based design approach would ask not how we can design interventions that reduce or replace the work of advocates, but how we can support and amplify it [18, 47, 67]. 2   Not Another School Resource Map  2  ProcIn order to allow researchers to better understand the development of SGAD, we divide SGADs into three stages: console games, computer games, and mobile games according to different game platforms (see Fig.1)The system has four main blocks: 1) The once-in-life-time factory fingerprint building, 2) the first-time-use fingerprint regeneration, 3) the keyboard designer, 4) and the keystroke recognitionSimilarly, recent guidelines for treatment of human patients recommend high-intensity, repetitive motions while keeping patients informed about their progress (Langhorne et al., 2009)Interact., 2022, November 12–16, 2022, Taipei, Taiwan  BACKGROUND: SCHOOL CHOICE POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGY  School choice policies in the United States have been promoted on the premise that families should be able to choose a school that they believe best meets their child’s needs, rather than being assigned to a school based on proximity or desegregation plans [74]Guo et al. (2019) also reported that the absence of a direct view to the real world makes surgeons nervousIf an inconsistency that does not involve any decision is detected, the given goal is valid3Looking 4   at the effects of different intensities of physical therapy treatment, several authors (Langhorne et al., 1996; Taub, 1999, 2000) have reported significant improvement in activities of daily living as a result of higher intensities of treatmentWii is a game console released by Nintendo in 2006The public school system in the United States is shaped by the history of legal and de facto racial segregation in schools and housing [70]More details of our combination techniques, which are not necessary to understand the rest of the paper, can be found here [6, 5, 10]These are the responsibilities of the “Offset Compensator”, “Factory Fingerprint Builder”, “First Use Fingerprint Regenerator”, and “Polarity Handler” modules. 1) Offset Compensator: Since the Earth’s magnetic field (BEarth ) varies at different locations and the background magnetic field strength (Bbackground ) dynamically changes, it is important for MagBoard to compensate for these changes to obtain a robust fingerprintPortability is appealing for Page 3 of 11   A review and primer for EDA in HCI both psychological research and clinical useUnfortunately, typical sessions with therapists include a relatively small number of motions (Lang and Gnip, 2007)School choice has been closely related to desegregation efforts, first as a way for white families to avoid integration [44], and later as an alternative to centralized redistricting or busing plans [54]Google Glass, released in 2013, is a lightweight monocular AR device enabling display of information while continuing daily lifeChuang conducted an experiment to study the effects of Wii play and Wii sport on ADHD children, and the results showed that ADHD children can feel more fun and improve their attention when playing games [16]Following Singh [89], a system is intelligent if we need to “attribute cognitive concepts such as intentions and beliefs to it in order to characterize, understand, analyze, or predict its behavior”To reason about axioms, Alt-Ergo uses an instantiation mechanism based on E-matching [12] techniquesChildren with ADHD often have defects in executive function, that is, it is difficult to complete tasks that require planning and organization [17]In psychology, wearable sensors allow experiments to take place in more ecologically valid settings [Betella et al., 2014], while in health care wearable sensors enable continuous physiological monitoring at a relatively low cost [Pantelopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010]To do that, whenever the system is started, we remove the effect of these two varying sources of magnetic field by collecting samples without the existence of the MagBoard’s magnet for a few seconds (15 sec)The Microsoft HoloLens, released in 2017, is a larger HMD that incorporates stereo vision, low latency room mapping and head tracking as well as gesture-based interaction using only the wearer’s handsUse SGADs can train for specific executive function deficits, experiments show that SGADs can increase the enthusiasm of children with ADHD to participate in treatment and improve the effect of executive function training [18]These policies can take many different forms, from subsidized private school vouchers, to charter schools1 , to transfers between public schools within a district or across district boundariesWe use the notation ∀~x [ p | p1 , p2 ]. φ (~x) 3 To prove validity, Alt-Ergo internally assumes the negation of the conclusion and tries to deduce unsatisfiability.   SPopular options in this regard are wearable EDA sensors, such as the ring-mounted Moodmetric (Vigofere Ltd., Helsinki, Finland); the wrist-worn E4 (Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA); or the edaMove (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), which combines a wrist-worn amplifier with wired electrodesHowever, while therapists prescribe a home exercise regimen for most patients, a study indicates only 31% of patients actually perform these exercises as recommended (Shaughnessy and Macko, 2006)More formally, from Equation 2, the measured magnetic field after silence removal becomes: BP  = =  Rx (φ)Ry (θ)Rz(ψ)[BT − Bsilence ] Rx (φ)Ry (θ)Rz(ψ)Bmagnet  (4)  where Bsilence = BEarth + BbackgroundNumerous other devices have appeared offering different levels of comfort and function (for a more detailed list of OST-HMD devices see section 4.3)The movement towards prioritizing parents’ individual choice of schools over centralized decision-making is reflective of a broader shift away from the redistributive principles of the civil-rights era towards marketization and individualism, values characteristic of neoliberalism [13, 76]Benzing [19] used Microsoft’s Xbox game console and equipped with Kinect equipment capable of motion recognition to conduct an intervention experiment on selected patientsIt provides users with what has been called a “right to explanation” [39], such as recently articulated in the GDPR [79], and ties lawful use of intelligent systems to the ability to make users understand their decision-making process [44]On the other hand a main problem arises when choosing which kind of home-based technology can both help and motivate patients to perform therapeutic exercises. 2Today, schools across the country remain heavily segregated by race and class, with large disparities in educational opportunities and resources available [66, 77]Mebsout  5  to indicate that ψ is associated with one mono-trigger {p}, and one multi-trigger {p1 , p2 }The evaluation results show that exercise games can not only reduce the inhibition of these patients and improve their responsiveness, but also improve the deficits in executive function.   3  01  03  02  console games  computer games  mobile games  Strong interaction, Good for exercise  More refined pictures a n d s p e c i a l e ff e c t s , Many peripherals  Portable, Easy to operate  Fig. 1Finally, we note that the phone location in MagBoard is fixed on the board relative to the grid (Figure 6), which makes MagBoard independent of the phone orientation as the phone attitude is always fixed relative to the magnetSuperimposed on the slow tonic component is a rapidly changing phasic component, skin conductance response (SCR); see, for example, Figure 2For example, the possibility of using ’virtual’ rehabilitation has been the subject of experiments by several authors (for example (Rizzo and Kim, 2005; Jack et al., 2001))Condino et al. (2020) concluded from their quantitative study that the HoloLens should not be used for high-precision manual tasksIn BCI technology, EEG equipment collects brain electrical signals and directly inputs brain activity to the computer, so no input devices such as a mouse and keyboard are needed to complete communication [20]In other words, the phone, magnet, and the board move together as a rigid body when the phone is rotated in 3D. 2) Factory-based Fingerprint Building: MagBoard stores the magnet effect/signature on the embedded magnetometer in the phone, in different board cells relative to the phoneFor instance, possible triggers for the axiom mem_add of Figure 2 are: {mem(x, add(y, s)) }  {add(y, s), add(x, s)}  ···  {x, y, s}  The latest multi-trigger is a very bad choice and is never selected by Alt-ErgoAlthough most of studies on this topic are linked to the study of virtual reality environments recent studies have focused on the use of videogames and consoles for rehabilitation (such as (Burke et al., 2009; Flynn, Sheryl et al., 2007)We define the purpose of this support by transferring a statement by Lynham from philosophy of science [73] to the context of our work: Supporting users in understanding intelligent systems means helping people to use a system better and in more informed ways, and to better ends and outcomesProponents of school choice argue that it has the potential to improve outcomes for underserved students by allowing them to choose higher-resourced schools outside of their neighborhood, and relying on market pressures to push lower performing schools to improve [43]The spike-like SCR corresponds to sympathetic arousal, resulting from an orienting response to either specific environmental stimuli, such as a novel, unexpected, significant, or aversive stimulus, or non-specific activation, such as deep breaths and body movements [Boucsein, 2012, Dawson et al., 2000]The two most popular commercial brain-computer interface devices on the market, Emotiv and NeuroSky, have been successfully applied to the control of electronic games [21].  According to different frequencies, EEG signals are divided into different frequency bands, which also correspond to different brain activitiesCarbone et al. (2020) also conclude that OST-HMDs are unsuitable for surgical guidance, suggesting that research should focus on addressing perceptual issues that play a critical role in limiting user accuracyHowever, only the first one will permit us to prove the validity of the example in Figure 2Figure 4 shows the relation between the magnetometer readings for two different magnets in shape and strength when positioned at the same locationResults of these studies can be summerized as follows: 1Similarly, Figure 5 shows that the relation between the magnetometer readings of two different phone sensors using the same magnet is also linearThe higher the ratio, the less concentrated the attention, and the higher θ/β ratio has become a biological characteristic of patients with ADHD [22]Following Boucsein et al. [2012], we recommend recording from the fingers to the extent that this is possibleOthers disagree, arguing that these policies can exacerbate segregation [85], drain resources at already struggling schools [34],2 and place too much responsibility on individual parents for the quality of their child’s education [75]Mental models originate from a constructivist perspective on knowledge, where knowledge is seen as individually constructed, subjective interpretations of the world, based on previous experiences and assumptions [97]Personalization: Virtual rehabilitation technology creates an environment in which the intensity of feedback and training can be systematically manipulated and enhanced in order to create the most appropriate, individualized motor learning paradigm (Jack et al., 2001)We find that collecting data from only two cells is sufficient for estimating the parameters accurately over duration of 15 sec for each cellFida et al. (2018) performed a systematic review of augmented reality in open surgery and conclude that such perceptual issues limit their usage to the augmentation of simple virtual elements such as models, icons or textTherefore, the fingerprint regeneration process takes less than one minute and is required only once for any new device or magnet. 4) Handling Polarity: Since the user can wear or hold the magnet arbitrarily, there can be a change of polarity (sign) of the magnetometer readings as show in Figure 7Therefore, in order to make the attention of ADHD patients more concentrated, training can be used in video games to reduce the ratio of brain waves θ/β [22]Rehabilitation using games can take advantage of the use of adaptation in order to create ad hoc personalized games. 2In this work, we focus on an existing choice plan, and study how the technology designed to support this plan enables low-resourced and marginalized families’ participation. 2.1  Case Study  In this work we study the public school enrollment system in Oakland, CaliforniaDilley et al. (2019) propose nearby presentation of correctly oriented but not registered modelsThe preprocessing is relatively simple: data are down-sampled or low-pass filtered, typically to <10 HzThe rest of the paper describes the features (and their implementation) that AltGr-Ergo offers and shows how they can be useful both from an end-user perspective as well as from a developer’s perspective.  3  Feedback  The first purpose of AltGr-Ergo is to provide feedback which can be useful at times to understand and evaluate what is happening inside the solverMoreover, we assume that knowledge is gained through the transmission of information between user and system. 4  METHOD  Here, we shortly describe the process of paper collection and interpretation through which we derived our framework. 4.1  Theoretical Sampling  Our paper set was collected using theoretical sampling, an approach to collection of qualitative data introduced by Glaser and Strauss as a part of Grounded Theory [37]Studies have shown that light music has the best effect and can effectively reduce the θ/β ratio [23]If event times are known, latency-based detection of SCRs can be performed, per Boucsein et al. [2012]Virtual rehabilitation exercises can 5   be made to be engaging, such that the patient feels immersed in the simulated worldGesture interactions with the AR view may prove difficult to combine with the manual surgical task itself (Solovjova et al., 2019)We did so first through collecting search terms for system qualities based on our experiences as researchers working at the intersection of HCI and AI for several years and then expanded our set of system qualities through the topic networks presented by Abdul et al. [1] in their 2018 survey of over 12,000 papers at this intersectionFeedback is useful for users as a visual aid to make sense of the solver’s progress, but it is also a precious tools for developers to profile and debug the solver.  3.1  Unsat Cores and Minimal Context Extraction  An unsatisfiable core in SMT, is a subset of the input formulas that make the problem unsatisfiable
