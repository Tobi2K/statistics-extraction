With this motivation in mind, we analyzed the reading behaviors of 285 Mechanical Turk participants who read articles on mobile devices with different familiarity and reading goal conditions
The developed models are further evaluated with a real-world BCI and achieve a recognition accuracy of 93% over five instruction intentions
We obtain a System Usability Scale (SUS) of 90 and a NASA Task Load index (TLX) score of 21 for the proposed visual programming compared to 68 and 52, respectively, for the traditional programming methods

Recent work has begun to explore within what context speech agents may be able to interrupt [9], yet we currently do not know how these interruptions should be designed, especially in contexts where this information may be urgent or time sensitive
During the experiment, 14 channel electroencephalogram, galvanic skin response, and photoplethysmogram signals were collected from each participant
Scalp-recording electroencephalography (EEG) is considered to be one of the most practical pathways to realize BCI systems due to its portable acquisition system and convenient implementation (Wang et Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org)
Similar to other speech technology work [13, 16, 28], our study aims to gather insight from humanhuman interaction to inform speech technology design

The added sensors have enabled a variety of popular applications ranging from GPS-based 1   Seshan Existing systems all suffer from some combination of inaccuracy, difficult deployment, and narrow range of recognized activities
However, DL model authoring has been a skill that is currently restricted only to experts 2
It has been attracting increasing attentions, and various research has attempted to engage EEG based BCI in real-world applications such as mind controlled wheelchairs (Wang et al. 2014), prosthetic (Bright et al. 2016) and exoskeletons (Qiu et al. 2017)

Thus, understanding attention can be important to improve the effectiveness, experience, and performance of many tasks [2]
A particularly important addition in recent smartphones is hardware support for Wi-Fi Round Trip Time (also called Wi-Fi RTT or 802.11mc) [19], which enables indoor localization with a precision of one to two meters

To make sense out of this kind of data, one must: (1) view data across a range of time scales (e.g., daily exercise fluctuations vs. monthly patient-reported outcomes vs. semi-annual doctor visits), (2) correlate across variables (e.g., does a change in medication correlate with changes in patient-reported outcomes?), and (3) compare across time intervals (e.g., has a patient’s current condition improved compared to historical data?)

Also, a typical EEG based BCI system usually has 8 to 128 signal channels resulting in limited signal resolution compared to image or video related tasks
Auditory attention and auditory perception are closely related processes; while perception is the process of interpreting information, attention is the process by which discrete pieces of information are selected or discarded [3]

However, these techniques often focus on homogeneous types of data (e.g., scalar valued time series) or have other constraints that limit their use (see Section 2)
Compared to other devices, such as desktop, people prefer mobile devices for particular types of reading, such as reading news articles [17]

Auditory perception is a complex brain process that involves encoding sounds into patterns of neural activity [4]

Datasets of physiological signals are available for a wide variety of applications, from paralysis [5] and epilepsy [6] studies, to applications for patients in a complete locked-in state [7, 8, 9] to emotion recognition [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and serious games [15, 16, 17]
Compared to paper-based media, reading on mobile devices has advantages in portability and easy access, but disadvantages in reduced readability and ease of navigation [25]
Springer, 2008 4 Elias Pampalk
While interrupting a task risks distraction, they may also bring benefits to productivity or facilitate a response to emergent tasks [24]
There is a lack of intuitive systems to author DL models in an easy fashion. 2
Our statistical analyses of user interactions during reading on mobile devices show that the different reading conditions lead to differences in touch and scroll interaction patterns (see Fig. 1)
Some methods include signal de-noising (Heydari and Shahbakhti 2015) or feature selection steps (Yin et al. 2017) followed by final recognition model
Widely used EEG datasets for BCI applications include motor imagery datasets [18, 19, 20]
Islands of music: Analysis, organization, and visualization of music archives. na, 2001 5 Otmar Hilliges, Phillipp Holzer, Rene Klüber, and Andreas Butz
There are several attention related datasets, including datasets for covert and overt visual attention [21, 22, 23] and for auditory-visual attention shift [24]
Lack of Interaction across Libraries: Different programming libraries exist for DL implementation such as Keras3 , Tensorflow4 , PyTorch5 , Caffe6
Section 2 provides an overview of the LEHAR system, including the system requirements and the key techniques used
Figure 1(b1 ,c,b2 ) shows an example that has two context zones, one to each side of the focus zone
Furthermore, even   Figure 1: EEG data acquisition and preprocessing
We also develop machine learning models that can automatically predict the reading conditions from user interactions achieving 56% accuracy in predicting familiarity level, and 68% accuracy in predicting reading goals
Interruptions are frequently studied in the form of notifications, which trigger task switches [22, 33], and as self-interruptions, in which task switching is self-triggered [11].   CUI ’21, July 27–29, 2021, Bilbao (online), AA, Spain  Critical to the study of interruptions is the observation of task switching between a main task (termed the primary task) and an interrupting task (termed the secondary task), with multitasking and interruptions being understood as a singular phenomenon on a continuum of time between these task switches [37]
In International Symposium on Smart Graphics, pages 82–92
Sections 3, 4, and 5 focus on the design of the core software components of LEHAR
Specifically for auditory attention based on EEG signals, an auditory oddball paradigm has been presented, where the response of participants to oddball sounds inserted in streams of sinusoidal tones was analysed [25, 26].   https://phyaat.github.io  Figure 1: Experiment Design  Among the wide variety of physiological datasets available, to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of datasets designed to study auditory attention to natural speech
When paying attention to interruptions, people tend to consider the impact of engaging in a secondary task on their primary task, balancing speed in completing tasks with avoiding errors in the primary task (known as the speed-accuracy tradeoff) [7]
However, there is limited interoperability across these libraries that enables a model designed and trained in one specific library to be accessible and re-usable across libraries. 3
These data vectors are then converted to 2D data meshes according to the electrode map of the BCI headset

Section 6 provides a detailed description of the results and an analysis of the data from this study
This motivates the periphery plot design space outlined in Section 3.2
The converted 2D meshes are finally segmented to clips using sliding window techniques. under intra-subject or binary classification scenarios, many existing works suffer poor performance near 80% accuracy
Although such a trade-off is considered, research on interruptions during driving shows that people tend to prioritize speed as a default strategy, interrupting a primary task as quickly as possible [20], having to be told to emphasise accuracy before it is prioritized [8]
In previous studies, familiarity with the article’s topic was considered a significant factor for the reader’s engagement level [22] and comprehension level [16]
Sankaran et al. [25] studied the challenges faced by a DL developer by conducting a qualitative survey among 100 software engineers from varying backgrounds. 83% of the participants responded that it took them about 3 − 4 days to implement a deep learning model, given the model design and choice to use any DL library
They encode quantities by length and are informed by neatly labelled axes and/or legends 6
With the goal of supporting future research in the field of auditory attention, we have designed an experiment based on the dichotic listening task [27], and collected a dataset of physiological signals that include 14 channel EEG, PPG and GSR
Discussion,  Related Work and Conclusions are presented in Sections 7, 8 and 9.  2  SYSTEM OVERVIEW  In this section, I describe the design of LEHAR
Other studies [6, 21] have suggested that more coherent text can improve reading comprehension for readers with low prior knowledge levels, while readers with more prior knowledge understand less structured and less consistent documents better
In recent years, deep learning’s revolutionary advances in audio and visual signals recognition have gained significant attentions (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015)
As shown in Figure 1(f), each track contains a periphery plot for each context zone and a single focus visualization corresponding to the focus zone
These tend to mark low-cost moments of interruption, that people are naturally good at coordinating, especially for self-interruption [2, 5, 24]
The contributions of this initial work include presenting bar charts to represent soft music genres, using bar charts as a slider in an User Interface(UI) and proposing a potential application these genre bars in a streaming application interface.  2  Marc Streit and Nils Gehlenborg
Interestingly, 86% of those respondents had rated themselves as highest in “programming ability"
Section 2.1 describes the key requirements that any system designed to perform HAR must address
Some recent deep learning based EEG classification approaches have enhanced the recognition accuracy (Bashivan et al. 2016; Tabar and Halici 2016)
The reader’s prior knowledge can also affect how the reader consumes and interacts with the article [19]
The dataset is available to the wider community for it to be used freely1
In addition, the tracks are stacked vertically with boundaries between zones aligned as shown in Figures 1 and 3
Bar charts and box plots, 2014 6  Soft Music Genres Music genres mostly are annotated according to hard clustering
These breakpoints, although useful for tasks that can be broken down into clear discrete units, are difficult for people to identify when tasks are continuous (i.e. when tasks are not reducible into discrete units of ongoing activities that do not overlap (see [25])
The survey also showed that more than 92% of the respondents wanted an interoperability framework to convert the code and model implemented in one library into another library
For example, studies have used the degree program of undergraduate students to determine their familiarity with an article [16, 21]
However, these approaches either focus on complex preprocessing, such as converting raw EEG signals to images (Bashivan et al. 2016), or neglecting the subtle spatial and temporal information contained within EEG signals
One example of such applications is the design of the difficulty levels of a game based on the level of auditory attention [28]
So given a set of three music genres, Jazz, Blues and Country, a song can very well belong to 50% Jazz, 25% Blues and 25% Hip-Hop
Complex continuous tasks that may not have clear natural breakpoints are difficult to model in terms of ideal interruption moments [38] making it difficult to design interruptions for these tasks
Any changes to the focus or context zones made through the control timeline are tightly coordinated with the tracks to support a range of interactions as described in Section 3.3.  2.1 Visual Representations of Temporal Data Time series data sets are ubiquitous and are most commonly represented as line charts
Many existing approaches to enabling HAR in homes require significant specialized infrastructure to be added around the house [16]. • Portable
Section 2 explains the experimental design, materials and procedures
In particular, we build a mesh-like raw EEG signal hierarchy from 1D chain-like EEG vectors by mapping the EEG recordings with the spatial information of EEG acquisition electrodes, to align the correlations between neighbouring EEG signals and corresponding brain areas
In the recent past, a few open source unified libraries were made available in the community such as Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) [10], nGraph from Intel [4], and Neural Network Exchange Format (NNEF) [8]
Studies of taxonomies in education [4] and reading [1] suggest there is a hierarchy of comprehension goals
Figure 1: A visual depiction of Hard and Soft music genres of two particular songs using bars
Both the cascade and parallel models achieve high accuracy of near 98.3% for movement intention recognition, significantly outperforming the state-  of-the-art methods by near 18%
Prior research has mainly focused on developing alternative visual encodings to convey equal information while using less space, such as horizon charts [8] and braided graphs [12]
Section 3 describes the collected dataset, labels and file structure
An example of such a work includes 7
Speech interfaces have been shown to effectively support the execution of complex tasks like preparing a presentation without dangerously interfering with driving [32]
For example, if the reader’s goal is to extract relevant information within a limited time frame, the reader might skim the article until she is satisfied with the findings [7]

In order to support applications that depend on the recognition of multiple related activities, a HAR system must identify activities with an accuracy of at least 95%. • Inexpensive
In Section 4, we analyse the correlation between attention score and auditory conditions
We also evaluate our models on a real-world BCI system, and obtain a satisfactory accuracy of 93% on recognizing five instruction intentions with limited EEG channels
For horizon charts, interpretability can be preserved and improved while reducing space usage by optimizing chart parameters (number of bands, height of chart) [10]

Visualizing music genres using a topic model. 2019 7  Bars as sliders in an UI Bar charts, as previously noted, have been and can potentially be used in a lot of different applications
However, speech-based multitasking is more suitable for particular primary tasks, such as those that do not also involve the production of language [14]
The colors in the graphs indicate example interactions captured from two participants (P001 and P002) that had different assigned reading goals (blue for C: contextual and orange for L: literal), but read the same (U: unfamiliar) article
For example, both ThemeRiver [9] and RankExplorer [18] utilize stacked graphs as a base chart to display categorical partitions of multi-variate time series data, while the latter layers additional glyphs to represent changes in information density between categories and time points
The files thus are allocated to 3 music genres in some proportions
In Section 5, we formulate the four predictive tasks and Section 6 describes the framework to extract the features from physiological responses
The primary aim of the user study is to verify the hypothesis that, in comparison with the traditional coding method for designing deep learning models, the visual programming [23] method is better in terms of ease-of-use, ease in adoption, and decreases the prototyping efforts
Retraining the machine learning model to recognize new activities can be easily automated, addressing the Extendable requirement.  Figure 1 provides a pictorial view of the communication infrastructure within the home used for testing
This reveals that our proposed models have robust capabilities to recognize diverse kinds of human intentions using different BCI systems.  The Proposed Method In this section, we describe the detailed architectures of the proposed cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent network approaches.  Converting 1D EEG Sequences to 2D EEG Meshes The overall EEG data acquisition and preprocessing flowchart of our proposed method is shown in Figure 1

Multitasking with speech interfaces while driving has been a particularly popular area of research, with a 2017 meta-review of 43 studies of voice-recognition systems in the car noting that these systems impose some penalty on driving performance, but less so than visual-manual interfaces [39]

Recent work has begun to explore the contexts in which more proactive interruption by speech interfaces may be possible [9]
This minimizes the localization error since the measurements to widely spaced access points produces a smaller intersection of potential locations.  2.2 LEHAR Hardware Overview Given the smartphone-based design of LEHAR, the hardware consists solely of the smartphone itself and the communication infrastructure associated with it
Typically, the raw data from EEG signal acquisition system at time index t is a one-dimensional (1D) data vector rt = [s1t , s2t , sit ... , snt ]T , where sit is the reading data of the ith electrode channel at time stamp t
Currently, we support Tensorflow v1.4, Keras v2.1, PyTorch v0.3, and Caffe v1.0.  1
These bars can be used to visually represent an entire genre dataset by means of an  3   music genre bars  underlying search algorithm; as in given a proportion (as displayed on the genre bar), find the songs that represent such proportion
Moreover, it can dynamically transition between types in response to changes in data density. 2.2 Detail and Context Interfaces Exploratory analysis often requires users to interact with data at a level of detail that cannot be displayed on a single screen
Overall, for this paper, we use four different types of reading conditions, combining familiarity and reading goals into a 2x2 framework that can cover a wide variety of reading scenarios (Table 1)
Section 8 concludes the presented work and discusses several directions for future research
While interactive methods such as zooming & panning offer the ability to view details otherwise hidden due to summarization, these interactions alone may obscure context and hinder interpretation due to narrow fields-of-view [4]
The work found that, when in the  Edwards, et al.  home, opportune moments for interruption are governed by aspects such as user busyness, primary task difficulty, the extent to which the primary task is repetitive, as well as a person’s social availability and mood [9]
Visual DL-IDE: A visual programming IDE enabling “nocode" intuitive way of designing deep learning models7 .  The main requirements for any deep learning tool to be usable can be summarized into three major categories:  2
Since my objective was to incorporate fine-grain location, I chose a smartphone and communication infrastructure that incorporates support for some of the newest localization techniques (802.11mc, aka

Seminal work on mixed-initiative interactions has also outlined ways of initiating proactive interactions more generally, emphasising social norms and attributes from human-human interaction, such as appropriate levels of formality in address, should be considered in the design of proactive agents [20, 21]
For the observation period [t, t + N ], there are (N + 1) 1D data vectors, each of which contains n elements corresponding to n electrodes of the acquisition headset
The former employs spatial separation to partition global and detailed information (e.g., Stack Zooming [11]) while the latter combines these displays in a single continuous view (e.g., PerspectiveWall [15] or fish-eye lenses [6, 19])
Our example (in Figure 3) demonstrates how an input of genre proportions by the user retrieves a selection of songs (a playlist) from a larger database labelled by soft music genres.  Discussion In this preliminary work, we presented the concept of music genre bars

From the EEG electrode map, it is observed that each electrode is physically neighboring multiple electrodes which   measures the EEG signals in a certain area of brain, while the elements of the chain-like 1D EEG data vectors are restricted to two neighbors
For instance, attention signals, such as eye movements, have often been considered a proxy of different cognitive states [13, 14]
Future exploration of this work would include incorporating 4 or more genres, larger genre datasets, automatic genre-labelling algorithms and novel methods for evaluation.  References Otmar Hilliges, Phillipp Holzer, Rene Klüber, and Andreas Butz

I choose a relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain phone, the Google Pixel 4a [11]
The entire system will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.  5
Audio stimuli were reproduced under three different auditory conditions (N ,S, and L) and following previous studies, the attention score A for each trial was computed from a transcribed audio message, by counting the number of correctly identified words [29, 30, 31, 32]
From this conceptualization, we convert the 1D EEG data vectors to 2D EEG data meshes according to the spatial information of the electrode distribution of the acquisition system
Access rituals are short verbal and nonverbal behaviors people engage in at the beginning of or the end of an interaction with another person, signalling a request for or a ceding of access to that person [17]
Mak and Willems [14] showed that different types of mental simulations during reading, such as simulating motor movements vs. perceptual recognition of the paragraph just read, are related to the duration of gaze
For the entire duration of the experiment, three different modalities of physiological responses (R) were recorded at the sampling rate of 128Hz
However, it focuses on views of context zones (rather than the focus) and includes a design space for various levels of contextual summarization. 2.3 Design Space for Multi-variate Time-Based Charts KronoMiner [20] presents a taxonomy for the design space of layouts for visualizing multi-variate, time-based data

I chose to use the Google Nest Wi-Fi Router and Google Nest Wi-Fi Point devices [10] for my infrastructure.  2.3 LEHAR Software Overview The overall structure of the LEHAR software is shown in Figure 2
I describe the software that performs this task in greater detail in Section 3
The details of the methods and materials are explained in subsequent subsections. 1  https://phyaat.github.io  2   https://phyaat.github.io  2.2  Stimuli  A total collection of 5000 audio files, each containing semantically correct English language sentence was obtained from the Tatoeba Project [33]
System Usability Study: A user study is conducted with 18 intermediate and expert deep lear ning developers to assess, and compare the traditional programming method with the proposed visual drag-and-drop user interface
In the context of beginning a conversation, like what occurs during a spoken interruption, people tend to use a number of common access rituals to initiate interaction [26], including verbal behaviors such as verbal salutes (e.g. “hi”), use of names or nicknames, or apologizers (e.g. “sorry” or “excuse me”)
