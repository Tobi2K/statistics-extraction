Some inhibitors like bananins, 5-hydroxychromone derivative, ADKs, and SSYA10-001 are under preclinical studies for the treatment of SARS-COV-2. 18 3CLpro (Nsp5) mediates Nsps maturation, which is vital for the life cycle of the virus. 3CLpro is first cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream Nsps at 11 sites to release Nsp4-Nsp16. 19 In-depth investigation of the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro makes 3CLpro an interesting target for anti-COVID-19 drug development
According to this organisation, since the onset of this disease until 27 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than half a million people in 136 countries, leading to the death of 23 335. 2 The identification of patients that might be infected is crucial so that they can be adequately screened, treated and/or isolated
A regular network, i.e., a network with all nodes of the same degree, will have ρ = 0, it is followed by networks with normal-like degree distributions, then networks with more heterogeneous ones, and will end up with networks with in which the probability P (k) of finding a node of degree k decays like distribution of the form P (k) ∼ k −1 , where ρ = 1
