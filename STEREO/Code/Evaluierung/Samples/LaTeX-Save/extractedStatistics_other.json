(Recall that gender was ranked last in our explanation (see \\u00a0<ref>).)              Counterfactual scenarios 47% of coded responses indicated that the provided counterfactual scenarios are appropriate, e.g., endorsing that they \\u201care all financial and based on the ability of the loan to be paid back\\u201d (#448).

Actionability of counterfactual scenarios was another important theme: 9% overall addressed this, being appreciative that some counterfactual scenarios are explicitly actionable (#836: \\u201cChanging the loan term is possible immediately\\u201d) and disenchanted when not (#462: \\u201cSome hardly achivable [sic] scenarios must be met to ensure the bank [will] be repayed [sic].\\u201d)  Some themes were addressed by fewer SPs but are highly interesting: one SP was, e.g., confused by the \\u201cdirection\\u201d of suggested changes: \\u201cInstead of a short loan amount term, it could be a bit longer\\u201d (#778).  Others were seemingly distracted by suggested changes that are (too) small: \\u201cThe incomes are so close to the required that it shouldn't matter\\u201d (#447).  Finally, some SPs hinted at potential inconsistencies between individual explanations: \\u201cIt seems odd that loan amount term is placed so low when it was one of the areas the individual could change to obtain the loan\\u201d (#435).     \\u00a7 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS   In this section, we link our quantitative results to qualitative insights to get a better understanding as to why certain effects were observed, and we analyze and discuss in more detail the findings from the fitted SEM.  Finally, we allude to several implications of our work.        Connecting quantitative and qualitative findings As observed in Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), both perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness increase as more explanations are provided to SPs\\u2014however, INFF at a much higher rate than TRST.  Interestingly, many SPs in the (Base) condition, who do not receive any further explanations w.r.t. the inner workings of the ADS, do not find this \\u201cblack-box\\u201d system to be overly problematic w.r.t. informational fairness: as can be seen in Fig.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>), SPs' responses for INFF are approx. equally distributed across ratings 1\\u20134.  This might be due to people's expectations; one SP simply stated that this \\u201cseems to be standard practice\\u201d (#1212) in terms of explaining ADS.  From Tab.\\u00a0<ref> (\\u00a0<ref>) we infer that providing relevant factors (F) to SPs does not significantly increase INFF.  A likely reason for this observation is that SPs asked for significant follow-up information w.r.t. how the factors are used for decision-making.  Both the differences for (F)\\u2192(FFI) and (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) are significant for INFF.  Considering the qualitative findings (\\u00a0<ref>), this seems little surprising as the complementary explanations (e.g., factor importance in (FFI) over (F)) were specifically requested by SPs.   While some explanations clearly helped SPs understand the given ADS better, they also reveal certain aspects that might be detrimental to people's trust.  Similar to INFF, one might have expected to see lower ratings for TRST in the (Base) condition.  Instead, SPs' responses for TRST are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 3 (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, \\u00a0<ref>).  Regarding marginal effects of explanations on TRST, we note that none of (Base)\\u2192(F), (F)\\u2192(FFI), or (FFI)\\u2192(FFICF) lead to statistically significant changes in SPs' perceptions.  As for (Base)\\u2192(F), SPs' trust appears to be hampered by the experience that certain (presumably) inappropriate factors (e.g., gender) are being considered by the ADS.  While the change (F)\\u2192(FFI) is marginally significant (p = 0.052)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.052\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Afterwards, they had to compare two lists of four EM artists' photos and select the most diverse list according to their social salient attributes (e.g. gender, skin tone, age).   Finally, we mixed the former tasks presenting two lists formed by four artists\\u2019 photos and corresponding tracks, and participants had to consider both tracks' musical features and artists' attributes when assessing the diversity of the lists.  Regarding the material included in the study, we manually searched tracks and artists' data in several websites such as MusicBrainz, Wikipedia, AllMusic, and also in artists' websites and electronic music magazines.   The anonymized responses, a facsimile of the survey designed for the study, and the complete list of tracks and artists presented are publicly available,[<https://zenodo.org/record/4436649>] and for a comprehensive description of the study we refer to <cit.>.  The study was an activity of the TROMPA project,[An international, publicly-funded research project: <https://trompamusic.eu/>] and followed the personal data management and ethical protocols approved within this project.  As a follow-up, we conducted 7 semi-structured interviews with 14 participants of the study, divided into focus groups of 2-3 participants when possible (P2 and P3; P4 and P5; P6, P7, and P8; P9 and P10; P11, P12, and P13), if not interviewing them individually (P1; P14).   We choose to collect qualitative data through focus group interviews because the interviewees shared the experience of having previously participated in the aforementioned study.   This sense of belonging to a group has been proven to facilitate the participants in feeling safe when sharing their opinions, making it possible to collect spontaneous data occurring thanks to the interaction among them <cit.>.   Interviewees were balanced in terms of gender (8 male, 7 female), mostly from Europe (86%), aged 18-45, and all of them hold a bachelors' degree or higher.   The majority declared to have received formal music training (71%), while only a few of them affirmed to regularly engage in playing, DJing or producing any kind of music (35%).   Regarding their listening habits, most of them described their musical taste as varied (79%), while less declared to listen often to EM (71%), and even less within EM described their musical taste as varied (57%).   The interview was divided into two main parts, lasting for a total of one hour for the focus groups, and half an hour for the individual interviews.  In the first part, we asked participants to discuss their strategy to assess the diversity of a music list while participating in the study.  In the second part, we centered the discussion around participants' experiences with Music RS, and the role that diversity may play in that specific scenario.   Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish and Italian, and then transcribed in English.  We started the analysis of the transcripts by doing open coding, annotating the several themes and categories touched by the interviewees.   Following, a process of axial coding was performed to connect the distinct categories and identify the shared themes, finally collapsing our findings into two main themes, reported in the next section.    \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Assessing the Diversity of a Music List   Interviewees mentioned several aspects related to what diversity means to them, and how it has been interpreted while comparing lists of tracks and artists.  When asked about their strategy in choosing the most diverse lists, they often started the discussion by self-identifying themselves as being or not experts in EM.   Those who do not identify as an expert of this genre highlighted how the diversity assessment has been mostly based on listenable characteristics.

We refer the interested reader to, among others, <cit.> for more in-depth literature on different XAI techniques and their inner workings.  Regarding the effectiveness of explanations, generally speaking, prior research has primarily focused on comparing individual explanation styles head-to-head (e.g., <cit.>), while little work has been done on evaluating the interplay of different styles, including potential complementarity.  <cit.> emphasize the sparsity of empirical work w.r.t. the effectiveness of explanations overall.        Perceptions towards ADS  A relatively new line of research in AI and HCI has started focusing on perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness in automated decision-making.  For instance, <cit.> and <cit.> compare fairness perceptions in ADS for distinct explanation styles.  Their works suggest differences in effectiveness of individual explanation styles\\u2014however, they also note that there does not seem to be a single best approach to explaining automated decisions.  A different line of research has examined people's moral judgments w.r.t. the use of specific features in ADS <cit.>, also with mixed empirical findings.  <cit.> compares perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness depending on whether the decision maker is a person or an algorithm in the context of managerial decisions.  Their findings suggest that, among others, people perceive automated decisions as less fair and trustworthy for tasks that require typical human skills.  <cit.> explore how algorithmic decisions are perceived in comparison to group-made decisions.  <cit.> combine a number of manipulations, such as favorable and unfavorable outcomes, to gain an overview of fairness perceptions.  An interesting finding by <cit.> suggests that fairness perceptions decline for some people when gaining an understanding of an algorithm if their personal fairness concepts differ from those of the algorithm.  <cit.> conducted workshops with people from traditionally marginalized backgrounds, inferring that awareness of unfairness in ADS can substantially affect trust in companies or products.   Some work has also assessed the impact of people's demographics (including gender <cit.>), as well as political views and task experience <cit.> on their perceptions.  <cit.> examined lay people's perceptions of different technical fairness notions for ADS, suggesting that people prefer notions related to meritocratic fairness <cit.>.  Regarding trustworthiness, <cit.>, e.g., concludes that it is important to provide the right amount of transparency for optimal trust effects, as both too much and too little transparency can have undesirable effects.  <cit.> also examined the relationship between explainability and trust(worthiness), urging system designers to engineer for trustworthiness (as opposed to trust), and indicating that explanations can be a crucial toolbox towards that goal.  Regarding perceptions of different social groups, <cit.> point out that prior studies have mostly recruited respondents from  <cit.>, which has predominantly white participants <cit.>\\u2014because of this, among other reasons <cit.> we have recruited our study participants through [ is a crowdworking platform for online research: <https://www.prolific.co/>] <cit.>.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Research gaps and our contributions  We aim to complement prior work to better understand how much of which information should be provided so that people are optimally enabled to understand the inner workings and appropriately assess the fairness and trustworthiness of ADS.  To that end, we conducted a randomized experiment to examine people's perceptions of informational fairness and trustworthiness towards an automated loan approval system, given different combinations of common explanations (relevant factors, factor importance, and counterfactual explanations).  While there exists prior work on trustworthiness perceptions for individual explanation styles, we see a significant gap w.r.t. assessing combinations of different explanations.  We argue that this is an important gap to fill because different explanations convey different information and will likely have to be leveraged complementarily (i.e., not in isolation) in practice.  On a related note, we also set about examining the marginal effects of providing certain explanations on top of others\\u2014which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been analyzed in depth before.  As a consequence, we alter the amount of information that different groups of people get to see.  We do by no means claim to examine these aspects exhaustively, but we hope that our work will be a stepping stone for further research.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we shift focus from examining distributive and procedural fairness perceptions to informational fairness.  In other words, we do not ask people whether they find particular ADS outcomes or procedures fair or not, but\\u2014broadly speaking\\u2014whether they feel they received sufficient information to assess a given system.  This is an important distinction.  Only very few works have considered the informational fairness dimension when experimentally evaluating effectiveness of ADS explanations: <cit.> only measure the understandability aspect of informational fairness for individual explanation styles; <cit.> and <cit.> assess informational fairness perceptions, but with a focus on comparing human with automated decision makers.  <cit.> and <cit.> conducted interviews <cit.> and workshops <cit.> to infer qualitative statements related to informational fairness; whereby <cit.> explicitly state that \\u201cmore research is needed to understand how different elements of algorithmic systems affect perceptions of [\\u2026] informational justice.\\u201d  Empirical work on the interplay of informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for ADS is, to our knowledge, entirely novel.  Finally, we also analyze the relationship between study participants' (self-assessed) AI literacy and their perceptions, and we qualitatively examine their answers to open-ended question regarding (in)appropriateness of explanations as well as what information they feel is missing (if any) to properly vet the given ADS.     \\u00a7 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES  The conditions of our experiment comprise different amounts of information that study participants get to see w.r.t. an ADS in the realm of automated loan decisioning.  Regarding the potential effects of varying amounts of information on our dependent variables of perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness, we formulate two research hypotheses based on preliminary qualitative insights w.r.t. people's desire for transparency and information <cit.> as well as prior findings from the psychology literature <cit.>.  First, assuming that explanations are not entirely lacking in content, we conjecture (similar to <cit.>) that more provided information leads to higher informational fairness perceptions.  Regarding effects on trustworthiness perceptions, we note that several factors contribute to a system's fairness <cit.>; among these are consistency (of decision-making procedures) as well as process and outcome control on behalf of decision-subjects <cit.>.  Process control means that decision-subjects have the \\u201cability to influence what [\\u2026] data is considered by the decision maker\\u201d <cit.>, and outcome control, borrowing from <cit.>, refers \\u201cto the ability to appeal or modify the outcome [\\u2026] once it has been made\\u201d <cit.>.  While we do not anticipate our employed explanations to readily increase perceptions of outcome control, we conjecture that certain information may enhance assumed process control, which, in turn, affects procedural fairness perceptions <cit.> and, ultimately, trust <cit.>.          H1 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of informational fairness towards the ADS increase.        H2 As the amount of information provided increases, perceptions of trustworthiness towards the ADS increase.   While investigating these relationships, we are not only interested in the effects of our conditions on informational fairness and trustworthiness but also in the relationship between the latter two.  Some prior work has examined the relationship between informational fairness/justice and trust/trustworthiness (e.g., <cit.>) in other contexts.  <cit.> identified a significant positive effect of informational justice on different facets of trustworthiness perceptions in one of their two examined settings in the realm of organizational justice.  Similarly, <cit.>, in the context of customer satisfaction in internet banking, found that informational fairness (as a component of overall systemic fairness) has a positive effect on trust.  Finally, <cit.> affirm that \\u201cconventional wisdom on the justice-trust connection\\u201d implies a causal path from (informational) justice to trust, and not the other way round.  While these works address different use cases, we conjecture a positive relationship between informational fairness and trustworthiness perceptions for our ADS setting as well:          H3 Perceptions of informational fairness relate positively to perceptions of trustworthiness.   Experts may have a different attitude towards procedures or phenomena that touch on their area of expertise than non-experts.  Slovic et al. <cit.>, e.g., found differences in risk perceptions between experts and lay people.  Regarding innovative (food) technologies, <cit.> notes that lay people may neither be able to assess risks nor benefits appropriately.  For the specific case of ADS, <cit.> found a significant effect of computer literacy on a mix of procedural and distributive fairness perceptions; specifically, their findings suggest that fairness perceptions are lower for people with lower computer literacy.  <cit.>, along the same lines, found that students' views on algorithmic fairness changed by increasing algorithmic literacy through lecture and discussion: students \\u201cbecame more likely to emphasize transparency, [and] more open to using algorithms rather than using judges.\\u201d <cit.>  Finally, intuition tells us that AI-literate people may \\u201cextract\\u201d more information and understanding out of ADS explanations (e.g., because they know how supervised ML in general works).          H4 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more informationally fair than people with little or no knowledge in the field.        H5 People with higher AI literacy perceive an automated decision system to be more trustworthy than people with little or no knowledge in the field.      \\u00a7 METHODOLOGY  We examine our hypotheses in the context of algorithmic lending.  We argue that this is a common context that affects many people at some point in life.  It is, furthermore, an area where ADS are typically already utilized within productive settings <cit.>.  Specifically, we confront study participants (SPs) with situations where a person was denied a loan.  Similar to <cit.>, we argue that, in practice, explanations are much more likely to be requested by decision-subjects in response to negative outcomes; or, in other words: if someone gets the loan, interest in how and why exactly the decision was arrived at will likely drop.  However, we do by no means imply that reactions to positive outcomes are unworthy of being examined\\u2014given budget constraints, we defer them to future work.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Study design  We choose a between-subject design with the following conditions: first, we reveal to SPs some basic information about the lending company.  We then explain that a given individual\\u2019s loan application was rejected by the company, as well as that this decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (see Fig.\\u00a0<ref> for the exact wording in our questionnaires).  Afterwards, we provide one of four explanations (i.e., conditions) to each SP.  Eventually, we measure the effects of assigning different conditions\\u2014and by design of the conditions, different amounts of information (AMTIN)\\u2014on two dependent variables: perceived informational fairness (INFF) and perceived trustworthiness (TRST) regarding the ADS.  (Recall that informational fairness perceptions do not involve an actual assessment of the system's fairness w.r.t. its processes or outcomes.)  Additionally, we measure the (self-assessed) AI literacy (AILIT) of SPs.  We analyze whether differences in SPs\\u2019 AI literacy affect their perceptions.  All measurement items are summarized in \\u00a0<ref>.  Note that for each construct, we measure multiple items; mostly drawn (and partially adapted) from prior work.       ADS Setup  The ADS for our study consists of a random forest classifier which predicts loan approval on unseen data and is able to output different explanations.  For training our model, we utilize a publicly available dataset on home loan application decisions <cit.>, which has been used in multiple data science competitions on .  Note that comparable data\\u2014reflecting a given finance company\\u2019s individual circumstances and approval criteria\\u2014might in practice be used to train ADS <cit.>.  The dataset at hand consists of 614 labeled (loan Y/N) observations and includes the following features: applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, dependents, education, gender, loan amount, loan amount term, marital status, property area, self-employment.  After removing data points with missing values, 480 observations remain, 332 of which (69.2%) involve the positive label (Y) and 148 (30.8%) the negative label (N).  We used 70% of the dataset to train our ADS and use the remaining 30% as a holdout set for the experiment.  After encoding and scaling the features, we trained a random forest classifier with bootstrapping <cit.>, which achieves an out-of-bag accuracy estimate of 80.1% on the held-out data.  We use this classifier's predictions on the holdout set as a basis for the upcoming conditions/explanations that the SPs are confronted with.  Since we are not asking to assess the actual (procedural or distributive) fairness of the ADS, it is not critical to quantify how fair the system really is\\u2014any such effort would be highly contestable anyhow, for reasons of incompatible fairness notions <cit.>.  The authors still (informally but independently) checked training data as well as output quality for any salient problems that may bias SPs' responses w.r.t. the dependent variables.           Explanations We impose several requirements on the explanations that we provide to SPs: overall, we employ only model-agnostic explanations <cit.> in a way that they could plausibly be provided to loan applicants (i.e., lay people) in real-world scenarios.  While explanations can be communicated in a wide variety of ways (see, e.g., <cit.>), we confine ourselves to textual explanations (esp. no visuals) to control for differences in conveyance.  We also pick explanations that are immediately understandable semantically\\u2014this is important so as to collect meaningful responses.  On a related note, we ensure that explanations are not too long, in order to account for known issues around information overload <cit.>.  Finally, and similar to <cit.>, we pick explanations that can plausibly provide insights about a system's \\u201clogic involved,\\u201d as required, e.g., by the GDPR.  Based on these preliminaries, we assign SPs to one of four conditions that involve combinations of explanations w.r.t. (i) factors considered by the ADS, (ii) relative importance of these factors, and (iii) counterfactual scenarios where a rejected applicant would have been granted the loan.  We acknowledge that additional explanation styles would be equally interesting to consider; however, in order to keep the experiment size manageable, we must defer them to future work.  Our first condition, (Base), only reveals to the SPs that the loan decision was communicated to the applying individual electronically and in a timely fashion (as in Fig. <ref>).  Apart from the (Base) condition\\u2014which might be regarded as a black-box system\\u2014all other conditions include the additional information that the loan decision was made by an ADS (i.e., automated).  The second condition, (F), consists of disclosing the factors, including corresponding values for an observation (i.e., an applicant) from the holdout set whom our model denied the loan.  We refer to such an observation as a setting.  In our study, we employ two different settings in each questionnaire, where settings are chosen at random from the pool of rejected applicants.  The authors, again, checked informally that no highly unusual (e.g., extreme outliers) settings were displayed that might distract SPs' perceptions and bias recorded responses.  Please refer to \\u00a0<ref> for an exemplary setting (introduction of use case plus conditions).  Next, we computed permutation feature importance <cit.> from our model and obtained the following hierarchy, using \\u201c\\u227b\\u201d as a shorthand for \\u201cis more important than\\u201d: credit history \\u227b loan amount \\u227b applicant income \\u227b co-applicant income \\u227b property area \\u227b marital status \\u227b dependents \\u227b education \\u227b loan amount term \\u227b self-employment \\u227b gender.  Revealing this ordered list in conjunction with (F) makes up our third condition, (FFI).  To construct our fourth condition, we conducted an online survey with 20 quantitative and qualitative researchers to ascertain which of the aforementioned factors are actionable\\u2014in a sense that people can (hypothetically) act on them in order to increase their chances of being granted a loan.  According to this survey, the top-5 actionable factors are loan amount, loan amount term, property area, applicant income, co-applicant income.  Our fourth condition (FFICF) is then\\u2014in conjunction with (F) and (FFI)\\u2014the provision of three counterfactual scenarios where one actionable factor each is (minimally) altered such that our model predicts a loan approval instead of a rejection.  Our four conditions are summarized as follows:    Note that the order of provided explanations ((Base)\\u2192(F)\\u2192(FFI)\\u2192(FFICF)) is not arbitrary: each subsequent condition provides the exact same information as the previous one and more.  Since, e.g., factor importances implicitly reveal which factors the ADS considers, this would not necessarily hold true for, e.g., (FI)\\u2192(FIF).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data collection      Study participants (SPs) for our online study were (voluntarily) recruited via  <cit.> and asked to rate their agreement with multiple statements w.r.t. our dependent variables as well as their AI literacy on 5-point Likert scales\\u2014where 1 corresponds to \\u201cstrongly disagree\\u201d and 5 denotes \\u201cstrongly agree\\u201d.  Additionally, we included multiple open-ended questions in the questionnaires to be able to better understand the reasoning behind SPs\\u2019 quantitative responses.  The SPs were randomly and in equal proportions assigned to one of the four conditions, and each SP was provided with two consecutive questionnaires associated with two different settings.  We collected 401 responses, of which 4 had to be eliminated due to failure to pass one or more attention checks.  Thus, we obtained 397 analyzable responses.  Among the SPs, 60% indicated to be male, 39% female, and the remaining SPs either responded with \\u201cnon-binary\\u201d or chose not to disclose their gender; 46% were students, 27% employed full-time, 8% employed part-time, 7% self-employed, 11% unemployed, less than 1% retired, and 1% chose not to disclose their profession.  The reported average age of SPs was 25.7.  SPs were monetarily compensated above the recommended min. pay of $6.50 per hour.    \\u00a7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES AND RESULTS   We now examine the effects of our conditions and people's (self-assessed) AI literacy on perceived informational fairness and trustworthiness of our ADS.  For our measurement model, describing a confirmatory factor analysis and reporting correlations and factor loadings, we refer the reader to \\u00a0<ref>.  In this section, we first present the results of group difference analyses for our conditions with tests for pairwise comparison.  After that, we report our findings on the validation of our hypotheses H1 to H5 with a full structural equation model.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Analysis of group differences   Since we cannot confirm the assumption of normality for all variables, we conduct multiple non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H tests for multiple group comparisons <cit.>.  Afterwards, we carry out pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests <cit.>.  With these tests, we initially assess the effects of our four conditions revealing different amount of information (AMTIN) on the constructs of informational fairness (INFF) and trustworthiness (TRST).  Overall, we find a significant effect between different conditions on perceptions of informational fairness  RPLUS MATCH  as well as on perceptions of trustworthiness (p < 0.001)\", \"statisticType\": \"other\", \"record\": {\"pval\": \"0.001\"}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}",

Second, an IR visualization allows aggregate marks to be unfolded.  An unfolding operation\\u2014typically triggered by a user interaction event such as selection or brushing\\u2014augments the aggregate marks with a visualization of the individual fold statistics that contribute to the aggregate measures.  In the ongoing roulette example, the fold data would show the variation in proportion of spins that result in black and red numbers across each of the n=5 independent folds.  Additional examples from our experimental prototypes are described in Section\\u00a0<ref>.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion   The ability to unfold aggregate measures into repeated measurements  is a central contribution of the IR approach.  By graphically depicting the repeatability of a particular measure across multiple folds, IR provides users with important and easy-to-interpret cues as to the variability of a given measure.  Traditional visualization methods do not convey this information, meaning it is often not considered when predictive conclusions are made by users.  Another benefit of IR comes from the aggregation function.  In particular, embedding within the visualization pipeline an ability to aggregate categorical values such as statistical significance classification can lead to more accurate results.  Repeated measures combined with voting-based aggregation can, for instance, reduce the exposure to Type 1 errors when looking for statistically significant p-values.

As seen in Figure\\u00a0<ref>-(a), this weight and bias result in different evaluation scores between the two ground truth, especially in the higher and lower range of scores.
