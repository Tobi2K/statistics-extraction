Next, when comparing the FoCs for each Weight level (see Figure <ref> left), Tukey's post-hoc tests demonstrated that, for the W0 Weight, the FoC was significantly higher for the Target task than for the other tasks (both p<.05).       In contrast, for the W25, W50, W75 levels of Weight, the FoC was significantly lower for the Free task than for the other tasks (all p<.05).     Finally, for the W100 Weight, the post-hoc tests did not exhibit any significant difference.  Thus, these results only support [H2] partially, as although the Free task (the less constrained task) consistently obtained the lowest FoC ratings (except for the W100), this effect was not visible between Target and Trajectory tasks.       As the ANOVA analysis indicated that the strongest effects originated from the Weight factor, to further characterize the relationship between FoC and the Weight factor, a linear regression analysis was conducted across participants for each task (Figure <ref> right).  The regression equations were   Free:  y    = 0.0487x + 1.77 (R^2=0.83)   Target:  y    = 0.0379x + 2.94 (R^2=0.65)   Trajectory:  y    = 0.0444x + 2.49 (R^2=0.73).   The regression equations exhibited linear positive correlations between the FoC and the Weight.  To determine whether the computed slopes differed significantly from 0, we computed the slope of each participant\\u2019s linear regression and conducted a t-test (H_0: Slope is equal to 0): (Free:  RPLUS MATCH ,  Target:   RPLUS MATCH ,  Trajectory:  RPLUS MATCH ).  The results of the t-test indicated that the mean slopes all significantly differed from 0.  These results further support [H1].

In addition, owing to the different natures of each task (aimed movement, path following task), we did not assess the differences among Tasks for the task completion time.

they are usually personal, i.e., multimedia that is related to the PwD and their life: images (88%), videos (73%), and songs (63%).     \\t\\t     \\t\\tImages are provided by relatives (81%), the PwD itself (44%), and friends (12%).      \\t\\tThey are mainly available as printed pictures in physical albums (96%), but they are also stored in the smartphone/tablet gallery (41%), or in the computer (27%).     \\t\\tMusic is provided by relatives (66%), Internet through music streaming services (46%), and the PwD (32%).     \\t\\tSongs are usually stored in tapes/CD (57%), streaming services on the Internet (48%), and the computer, smartphone or tablet (45%).     \\t\\tVideos are provided by relatives (83%), PwD (24%), and friends (21%).     \\t\\tThey are stored in the computer, smartphone or tablet (71%), and tapes/DVD (43%).      \\t\\t             \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 PwD Emotional Reactions          \\t             When reviewing our memories, it is common to have different emotional reactions - either positive or negative - depending on the memory in question. \\t\\t\\tRegarding the emotional reactions that occur during sessions, caregivers reported that they either perceive what the PwD is feeling (62%) or the PwD is able to describe what he/she is feeling (46%). \\t\\t\\tConsidering the different multimedia used within sessions, images (66%) and music (55%) lead to some kind of positive reaction (e.g., enthusiasm, joy, etc.) from PwD. \\t\\t\\tNegative emotional reactions occurs during sessions (64%). \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\tThe main situations in which PwD experience negative emotions are: i) related to cognitive-impairments (58%) - not being able to remember something (e.g., when the memories do not line up with the reality), confusion (e.g., PwD is able to recognize a person in the image but not being able to recall his/her name), and the inability to express what he/she is feeling; ii) autobiographical memories (44%) - remembering (or seeing pictures of) loved ones that have passed away, and bad memories from their lives (e.g., abusive parents or spouse, or a divorce). \\t\\t\\tWhile experiencing negative emotions, PwD's have multiple reactions: behavioral, i.e., getting agitated, aggressive, detached, and anxious (56%), verbal (49%), and emotional, mainly through crying (47%). \\t\\t\\tFollowing, we present some quotes of the informal caregivers that exemplify each of the situations reported.                                                In order to cope with the negative emotional reactions, caregivers adopt different strategies: \\t\\t    verbal actions toward the PwD (67%), change environment/theme/activity (50.00%), and non-verbal actions toward the PwD (21%). \\t\\t    We can see in the following quotes that caregivers usually talk with the PwD, trying to calm them down by rationalizing and validating what the PwD are feeling, as well as helping them deal with the triggered memories.  \\t\\t    However, sometimes, they opt to avoid continuing to talk about specific themes to not worsen the PwD's (or they own) emotional state.                                                \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Life Story Book                       LSB are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories <cit.>. \\t\\t    They are the result of a life review process performed by the PwD with the support of staff and family members to build a personal biography that acts as a bridge to the past and a connection to the present. \\t\\t    It can be a very time-consuming task since it may require help from third parties to collect the information, which may not always be feasible or practical. \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Only 23% of the caregivers have currently a LSB of the PwD, but the majority of the remaining ones are interested in having one (80%). \\t\\t    Although we have not collected data to directly answer why most caregivers do not have an LSB of the PwD, as we can see in the following quotes, our open-end questions allow us to hypothesise that it is due to the amount of work (and stress) caregivers already have in their daily live. \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t     \\t\\t    Considering those that already have the LSB or are interested in having one, they mainly prefer to store it the old fashioned way, i.e., physically, such as an album of photos (82%). \\t\\t    Eighty-two percent of caregivers had (or want) to have help in the process of creating the LSB, and usually they spend (or are willing to spent) up to 10 hours in this process (60%). \\t\\t    The information is obtained in-person (81%), by e-mail (24%), and through social networks (23%). \\t\\t    Finally, caregivers indicate that relatives (91%), PwD (62%), friends (57%), and the caregivers themselves (49%) should have access to the LSB.                     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Interest in Technological Functionalities               Caregivers are very interested in all the technological functionalities (median of 4 in 5 for each) that may help to revisit older memories from their loved ones or to create an LSB, namely: i) automatically retrieving new images; ii) retrieving life-based images (of the PwD), iii) retrieving interest-based images (e.g., favorite artist, hobbies); iv) adapting current session (based on a negative emotional reaction to an image); v) adapting future sessions (based on the negative emotional reactions that occurred).         \\t                                           We further analyzed if the interest in any of the functionalities is associated with currently performing (or  not) the reminiscence therapy, already having a LSB or interest in having one, and finally, the overall daily stress, daily stress and daily work due to the PwD.                                           \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Automatically retrieving new images                      The interest in creating LSB has a significant effect on the level of interest in this functionality ( RPLUS MATCH ).                     Post-hoc analysis reveals a statistically significant difference for all pairs: do not want vs want (p<.00001), do not want vs maybe want (p<.00001), and want vs maybe want (p<.00001).                                                        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Retrieving life-based images                      The interest in creating a LSB has a significant effect on the interest in this functionality (\\u03c7^2(2)=74.407, p<.00001\", \"statisticType\": \"cstest\", \"record\": {\"X2val\": \"74.407\", \"N\": \"2\", \"pval\": \".00001\", \"V\": null}, \"aspect\": null, \"condition\": null}"
