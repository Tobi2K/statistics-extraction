Subjective human ratings of the model explanations are commonly used as a direct approach for evaluating machine learning explanations by providing a numerical rating of explanations goodness using a simple quantitative measure such Likert scales.  However, subjective measures typically lack precision and may include user bias.  We hypothesize that results from human-judgment scores will be significantly different for both (human-attention mask and object segmentation mask) ground truth evaluations.   We use the same subset of images and saliency map explanations from Grad-CAM technique similar to the previous section for the purposes of this human-subjects study.  Figure\\u00a0<ref>-(Top) shows examples of heatmap overlays from the Grad-CAM technique used in the user study.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Human Judgment Interface and Data Collection    We designed a simple interface to collect user feedback about the quality of heatmap overlays from the Grad-CAM saliency explanation technique.  The participants started by reading task instructions followed by a series of images for review and rate.   Given an image from the test set, the target classification, and a heatmap overlay, participants were instructed to \\u201creview and rate the heatmaps which explain what parts the AI used to make it's classification decision\\u201d and were asked to rate the \\u201cgoodness\\u201d of the AI decision on the scale of 1 to 10.  A total of 200 unique participants' were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and paid $0.20 per HIT to review and rate 14 images.  The first four image ratings (identical images were used for all participants) were used as training and attention check examples; these were disregarded for data collection.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results:   Figure\\u00a0<ref>-b shows a scatterplot of the evaluation scores (1.0\\u00a0- MAE) between human judgment ratings and ground truth scores from objects' segmentation masks and human attention masks.  The two regression lines for human-attention ground truth (in orange) and segmentation mask (in blue) show both baselines produce different evaluation scores from the user rating scores.   To test for the statistical significance of observed differences, we first normalize user ratings across participants by subtracting each participant's mean rating.

Our experiments also revealed user biases on different explanations' visual appearance and error types in the subjective rating of explanations.    \\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   This research is based on work supported by the DARPA XAI program under Grant #N66001-17-2-4031 and NSF award #1900767.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Comparison to Human Judgment    In the second evaluation experiment, we compare explanation evaluation scores using the two ground truth baselines with the human ratings of explanation goodness.  Subjective human ratings of the model explanations are commonly used as a direct approach for evaluating machine learning explanations by providing a numerical rating of explanations goodness using a simple quantitative measure such Likert scales.  However, subjective measures typically lack precision and may include user bias.  We hypothesize that results from human-judgment scores will be significantly different for both (human-attention mask and object segmentation mask) ground truth evaluations.   We use the same subset of images and saliency map explanations from Grad-CAM technique similar to the previous section for the purposes of this human-subjects study.  Figure\\u00a0<ref>-(Top) shows examples of heatmap overlays from the Grad-CAM technique used in the user study.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Human Judgment Interface and Data Collection    We designed a simple interface to collect user feedback about the quality of heatmap overlays from the Grad-CAM saliency explanation technique.  The participants started by reading task instructions followed by a series of images for review and rate.   Given an image from the test set, the target classification, and a heatmap overlay, participants were instructed to \\u201creview and rate the heatmaps which explain what parts the AI used to make it's classification decision\\u201d and were asked to rate the \\u201cgoodness\\u201d of the AI decision on the scale of 1 to 10.  A total of 200 unique participants' were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and paid $0.20 per HIT to review and rate 14 images.  The first four image ratings (identical images were used for all participants) were used as training and attention check examples; these were disregarded for data collection.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results:   Figure\\u00a0<ref>-b shows a scatterplot of the evaluation scores (1.0\\u00a0- MAE) between human judgment ratings and ground truth scores from objects' segmentation masks and human attention masks.  The two regression lines for human-attention ground truth (in orange) and segmentation mask (in blue) show both baselines produce different evaluation scores from the user rating scores.   To test for the statistical significance of observed differences, we first normalize user ratings across participants by subtracting each participant's mean rating.   Then, we use a Pearson's correlation test and linear regression test to compare the human judgment rating scores and the two ground truth scores.
