To investigate this question we used the AMS questionnaire.  The AMS provides overall scores for each type of motivation, and each type is further distinguished into more specific motives: IM - to know describes actions performed for the pleasure and satisfaction derived from the learning, exploring, or trying to understand something new from an activity, IM - toward accomplishment relates to engaging in actions for the pleasure and satisfaction experienced when trying to achieve something new or beyond one's limits, IM - to experience stimulation describes the motivation related to the experiencing of pleasurable sensations, EM - externally regulated indicates the behaviour is motivated by reasons external to the task at hand, i.e., payment or rewards, EM - introjected refers to actions motivated by pressure an individual puts on themselves, and EM - identified describes behaviour that is motivated by the view that participation is important for personal growth <cit.>.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.     Haptic assistance, haptic shared control, artificial neural networks, driving skill, simulated driving, motor performance.       \\u00a7 INTRODUCTION       Haptic assistance provides assistive feedback in the form of tactile or kinesthetic stimuli in order to facilitate the execution of or expedite the learning of motor tasks.     In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

We have built a haptic driving training simulator to collect expert driving data and to provide proper haptic feedback.     We establish an expert driving skill model by training NNs with the collected data.     Then, the skill model is applied to performance-based haptic assistance to provide optimized references of the steering/pedaling movements.     We evaluate the skill model and its application to performance-based haptic assistance in two user experiments.     The results of the first experiment demonstrate that our skill model has appropriately captured experts' steering/pedaling skills.     The results of the second experiment show that our performance-based haptic assistance can help novice drivers perform steering as expert drivers, but cannot assist their pedaling performance.     Haptic assistance, haptic shared control, artificial neural networks, driving skill, simulated driving, motor performance.       \\u00a7 INTRODUCTION       Haptic assistance provides assistive feedback in the form of tactile or kinesthetic stimuli in order to facilitate the execution of or expedite the learning of motor tasks.     In particular, kinesthetic feedback is effective in delivering mechanical momentum and moves the limbs of interest, supplying more direct, detailed, and continuous information.     A number of studies have examined the effects of kinesthetic assistance on a variety of tasks\\u00a0<cit.>.     Driving is the representative area where haptic assistance has been actively studied and adopted\\u00a0<cit.>.     Modern vehicles are controlled by a manual interface (steering wheel, accelerator/brake pedals, etc.) that requires complex coordinated dynamic control of the limbs.     Therefore, while driving, the driver and the car are in a continuous loop of human-machine shared control in which both agents constantly interact with each other and share a common goal to perform an effective, safe, and robust driving together.     Many studies have demonstrated that haptic assistance can effectively improve the performance of basic driving maneuvers (steering\\u00a0<cit.> and pedaling\\u00a0<cit.>) by augmenting the shared control loop.     This control mechanism is also called haptic shared control because the augmented information flows bidirectionally within the two agents via haptic channels at the mechanical contact of the interfaces in the loop\\u00a0<cit.>.      Haptic guidance, one of the effective haptic assistance methods, is the most straightforward application using haptic shared control.     Haptic guidance provides the user with external haptic stimuli to guide the desired movement during task execution\\u00a0<cit.>.     Here the haptic assistance system plays the role of a collaborator that encourages appropriate maneuvering movements and corrects the users' performance.     Therefore, this approach is considered as a bridge to automated driving with improved performance and reduced effort\\u00a0<cit.>.     Automobile companies have begun to include haptic assistance in an advanced driver-assistance system for lane keeping, intelligent parking, and adaptive cruise control\\u00a0<cit.>.     Another major promising area that haptic assistance greatly contributes is skill transfer regarding the long-term learning effects on motor skill performance\\u00a0<cit.>.     Several studies have investigated the effects of various types of haptic assistance for learning driving skills in simulated environments\\u00a0<cit.>.  \\t \\t      In both areas of shared control and skill transfer, the present design is generally performance-based; the system continuously monitors the user's current driving performance and then delivers adaptive haptic feedback.     It requires the process of quantifying the task performance in reference to the desired driving, often called a modeling process.     However, the conventional modeling process essentially requires well-parameterized physical formulas and their parameters, which demand excellent prior knowledge earned from the tidy investigation about driving.     Therefore, it is difficult to consider realistic human behaviors thoroughly, and sometimes it is simplified without behavioral characteristics.     As a result, it is sometimes possible that the performance assessment is based on an erroneous error measure, which is likely to degrade the performance of shared control or skill transfer.      In this paper, we address a data-driven framework of performance-based haptic assistance, especially for driving skills\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     First, we build an optimized black-box model for the target skill and then use the skill model for performance-based haptic assistance.     We record how experienced drivers perform driving (without haptic assistance) in realistic virtual environments, and then train the adequate continuous model of relevant variables from the collected data.     The data-driven approach is being popularly considered and adopted as a model of driving skills, sometimes with advanced machine-learning techniques\\u00a0<cit.>.     In this regard, we use shallow but cost-effective (artificial) neural networks (NNs) in order to provide real-time haptic feedback.     Some researchers have suggested the feasibility of NN models in accounting for human driving skills of steering control\\u00a0<cit.>.     In particular, Nechyba and Xu used NNs to model human driving strategies from data collected in simplified driving simulations using a mouse interface\\u00a0<cit.>.     Their NN models can produce predictive trajectories of steering and pedaling, based on individual data.     However, because their research did not include realistic driving hardware, the usefulness of their behavioral model and its applicability to haptic assistance require further verification.        Consequently, the NN models trained with expert driving data may compute and provide optimized device trajectories, as an expert driving skill model.     The expert skill model is then integrated into performance-based haptic assistance to provide appropriate haptic feedback as a reference of expert actions in steering and pedaling.     We assess the adequacy of the expert skill model and its application to the framework, in two user experiments.     Experiment\\u00a0I validates the skill model in terms of generalizability to complex environments and expressiveness of expert driving skills.     In Experiment\\u00a0II, we test if our performance-based haptic assistance can actually enhance the driving performance of novice drivers driving when the skill models are used as a reference.     To our knowledge, novel contributions of this work lie with the introduction of data-driven skill models that represent human expert skills for haptic assistance.      \\u00a7 SIMULATOR    \\tWe developed a driving simulator (Fig.\\u00a0<ref> and <ref>) for data acquisition and haptic assistance.     For data acquisition, the simulator records the driving data of users.     It provides realistic driving environments, including torque feedback to the steering wheel and pedals.     For haptic assistance, the simulator generates torque feedback assisting driving skills.     It renders audiovisual driving environments using Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) <cit.>, a commercial vehicle physics engine running in Unity\\u00a05 (update rate 50 Hz).     For car dynamics, a specific vehicle (Genesis, Hyundai Motors) is chosen to determine the physical parameters of VPP, such as the mass (1900 kg), dimension (1.8 W \\u00d7 4.6 D \\u00d7 1.5 H, in meters), steering ratio (12.0:1), gear ratios, and engine power curves\\u00a0<cit.>.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Hardware    \\tThe simulator consists of a large visual display, a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal\\u00a0(Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tAll devices are fastened to an aluminum frame to imitate a real driving seat. \\tWe use a 55-inch LCD (55LW6500, LG Electronics), and the distance from the display to the seat is approximately 1.2 m for a comfortable field of view of 60 ^\\u2218. \\tThe simulator uses a commercial steering wheel (SENSO-Wheel SD-LC, SensoDrive) to provide high-fidelity torque feedback.     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques are 16.58 Nm and 7.5 Nm, respectively.   \\tWe custom-designed the accelerator and brake pedals.     Two sets of AC servo motor (SGMGV-20A, Yaskawa Electrics) and servo pack (SGDV-18011A, Yaskawa Electrics) are used to provide independent torque feedback. \\tThe devices and PC communicate using a MechatroLink-II network control board (PCI-R1604-MLII, Ajinextek).     The maximum instantaneous and continuous torques of the two motors are 27.8 Nm and 10 Nm, respectively. \\tFor compact housing, both motors should be mounted on the same side, maintaining the alignment of the two rotation axes of the pedals.     For this reason, while the accelerator pedal is directly connected to one motor with a coupler, the brake pedal is connected to the other motor through a four bar mechanism. \\tThe steering wheel and the pedals are controlled at a sampling rate of 800 Hz.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Torque Feedback        The steering wheel angle \\u03b8_s is between \\u03b8_s, min (-459 ^\\u2218) and \\u03b8_s, max (459 ^\\u2218) with the built-in simulation of mechanical end stops in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.     To provide useful information about the road and vehicle status, the simulated steering torque T_s is implemented such that it is similar to the real torque transmitted from the driving shaft:   \\tT_s     = T_s, align + T_s, damping + T_friction,  \\twhere T_s, align is the self-alignment torque, and T_s, damping and T_friction are the viscous and Coulomb frictions computed from the car dynamics, respectively. \\tIn four-wheel drive, the steering reactive torque can be estimated as follows\\u00a0<cit.>:   \\tT_s, align \\u2248G_shaft \\u00b71/2 ( F_fl + F_fr ),  \\twhere F_fl and F_fr are the lateral forces applied to the left and right front wheels obtained from VPP.     G_shaft is the simplified gain of torque transmission from the shaft.     T_s, damping=-D_s\\u03b8\\u0307_s, and T_s, friction is a constant, both in the opposite direction of the steering wheel rotation. \\tFrom (<ref>), a user can perceive driving-like sensations on the road with respect to the direction and velocity of the virtual vehicle. \\t \\tThe haptic pedals are controlled using a spring-damper impedance control scheme.     If the accelerator angle \\u03b8_a is between \\u03b8_a, min=0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218, it is normalized and sent to the throttle value of the virtual car engine in VPP. \\tThe torque to the accelerator is computed as follows:   \\tT_a     = T_a, spring + T_a, max + T_a, damping + g ( \\u03b8_a ),  \\twhere T_a, damping=-D_a\\u03b8\\u0307_a is the virtual damping torque and g ( \\u00b7) is for gravity compensation. \\tThe spring-like restoring torque T_a, spring is determined by   \\tT_a, spring     = -K_a ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, 0 ),  \\twhere K_a is the virtual spring coefficient, and \\u03b8_a, 0 = \\u03b8_a, min - 5^\\u2218 = -5^\\u2218 is the initial position of the accelerator pedal.     T_a, spring pushes the driver's right foot upward to deliver information about how much s/he is pressing the pedal from \\u03b8_a, 0.     T_a, max is a unilateral feedback term to provide information regarding the maximum angle such that   \\tT_a, max     = \\t \\t\\t0       if  \\u03b8_a < \\u03b8_a, max   \\t\\t-K_a, max ( \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max )       if  \\u03b8_a \\u2265\\u03b8_a, max \\t     .  \\tT_a, max enables the driver to perceive the virtual endpoint at \\u03b8_a, max=10^\\u2218.     We used K_a, max = 10 K_a.  \\tThe torque to the brake pedal, T_b, is computed similarly for the brake angle \\u03b8_b.     The only difference was that the maximum brake angle \\u03b8_b, max=5^\\u2218.    \\tWe carefully tuned all of the other parameters to achieve realistic experiences, and their values are specified in Table\\u00a0<ref>.       \\u00a7 SKILL MODELING USING NEURAL NETWORKS        Performance-based haptic assistance requires an optimal (desired) behavior as the ground truth for error computation\\u00a0<cit.>.     In our case, the task performance can be represented by the position error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d, for the current position (of the steering wheel and the brake pedal) \\u03b8 = [ \\u03b8_s \\u03b8_a]^T and the desired position \\u03b8_d = [ \\u03b8_s, d \\u03b8_a, d]^T.     In our approach, the desired position \\u03b8_d is generated by two respective NNs for \\u03b8_s, d and \\u03b8_a, d.     This is the most distinctive feature compared to prior schemes for performance-based haptic assistance.     The two NNs are trained with prerecorded trajectories of successful driving runs by experienced drivers, which represent optimized steering and pedaling actions.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Structure    \\tIn <cit.>, the dynamic nature of human control strategy is abstracted into a static mapping between input and output using feed-forward neural networks. \\tIn fact, a dynamic system can be approximated using difference equations\\u00a0<cit.>, such that   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [      u [ k ], u [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, u [ k- ( D_u-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   x [ k ], x [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, x [ k- ( D_x-1 ) \\u03c4],   \\t\\t\\t   z [ k ], z [ k-\\u03c4], \\u22ef, z [ k- ( D_z-1 ) \\u03c4]], \\t      where f [ \\u00b7] represents a nonlinear function, u[ k ] is the control vector, x[ k ] is the system state vector, and z[ k ] is a vector that describes exogenous environmental features, all at time k. \\tThen, (<ref>) can be rewritten as   \\t \\t\\tu [ k+\\u03c4] = f [ u\\u0305 [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ], \\t      where m\\u0305[ k ] = [ m[ k ], m[ k - \\u03c4], \\u22ef, m[ k - ( D_m - 1 ) \\u03c4] ]^T for an arbitrary vector m.      We use a neural network to find f providing the estimate \\u00fb[ k ] = f [ u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], z\\u0305[ k ] ].     The network is trained on the input-output data by minimizing the cost function                C     = RMS ( d\\u0303 ),           d     = \\u00fb [ k ] - u [ k+\\u03c4],           where m\\u0303 is a time series of m, and RMS ( m\\u0303) computes the root mean square of all data in m\\u0303.     In results, the output vector \\u00fb[ k ] from the neural network estimates u[ k + \\u03c4] (after \\u03c4-samples) from the current and previous states of u\\u0305[ k ], x\\u0305[ k ], and z\\u0305[ k ].     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition   \\t  \\tWe designed 25 two-lane paths to collect driving trajectories and other important variables for skill modeling.     The width of each lane is determined by the real standard of 3.8   m\\u00a0<cit.> which is enough to maintain the free-flow speed of the vehicle\\u00a0<cit.>.     Each path consists of three segments with a total length of 600 m. \\tThe first and the third are 200-m straight segments. \\tThe second is a curve with curvature \\u03ba= 1/R = |\\u03d5|/L, where R is the radius, L is the arc length, and \\u03d5 is the angle in radian (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe value L of the second segment is 200 m, but each path has varying \\u03d5 from -180^\\u2218 to 180^\\u2218 in 15^\\u2218-step (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\t\\u03d5=0^\\u2218 results in a 600-m-long straight path.         Five experienced drivers (\\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5; all males; age 25\\u201351 years, M\\u00a037.6, SD\\u00a010.8; driving experience 5\\u201330 years, M\\u00a015.2, SD\\u00a010.3) participated in the data acquisition.     They were instructed to complete driving while staying only in the first lane of the path and maintaining 60 km/h velocity on the speedometer.\\t     Each trial took about 36\\u201340 s, and each driver completed six trials for each path (150 trials per driver).     All human experiments in this paper (data acquisition, Experiment\\u00a0I, and Experiment\\u00a0II) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the authors' institution (PIRB-2017-E066).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Neural Network Design and Implementation        \\tDuring the data collection, the experienced drivers did not use the brake pedal for lane keeping and speed control.     So we exclude \\u03b8_b from the control vector. \\tIn addition, we do not consider the interdependence in control between the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal and train separate neural networks for each.     This allows us to use more compact networks with accurate modeling results.     Hence, in the model for steering, u = \\u03b8_s, and in the model for pedaling, u = \\u03b8_a.     For the vehicle state, we use x= [ v   \\u03c9   r ]^T, where v is the longitudinal velocity (m/s), \\u03c9 is the angular velocity (degree/s), and r is the engine revolutions per minute (RPM) of the virtual car.      The environmental features are defined by using d_i  ( i = 1, \\u22ef,  5; Fig.\\u00a0<ref>).     Total five directions in relative angles of -30^\\u2218, -15^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218, 15^\\u2218, and 30^\\u2218 to the frontal direction are selected. \\tThe angles are determined considering the driver's vision capability based on the field of view (60^\\u2218) within the simulated vehicle. \\tThe maximum value of d_i is set to 60 m.     Then, the environmental feature vector z= [ z_1    z_2    z_3    z_4    z_5 ]^T, where   \\tz_i = 1/ 1 + d_i.      z_i represents the future hazard of collision in the i-th direction.  \\tThe two NNs, f_s and f_a, for the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are trained with the prerecorded input-output data as follows:  \\t\\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4] = f_s [ \\u03b8\\u0305_s [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ],    \\t\\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4] = f_a [ \\u03b8\\u0305_a [ k ], x\\u0305 [ k ], z\\u0305 [ k ] ].       The trained outputs \\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a then approximate the control action that the experienced drivers would make after \\u03c4 given the current and previous states of \\u03b8_s, \\u03b8_a, x, and z.   \\tConsidering that the human motion bandwidth is less than 5 Hz\\u00a0<cit.>, we use the same constants: \\u03c4=10 and D_u=D_x=D_z=5. \\tThen, the NNs simulate 0.2-s future values of execution from the five current and previous variables in 50 Hz. \\tBefore training, all input-output vectors, u, x, and z are normalized.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Training Results    \\tWe trained all NNs using MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks). \\tSpecifically, we use gradient descent backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate and a transfer function of the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. \\tThe initial learning rate is 0.5. \\tEach NN consists of four hidden layers with 32, 24, 16, and 8 nodes. \\tThe input-output data of all the experienced drivers are pooled for training.     The data are partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in the proportions of 70 %, 15 %, and 15 %, respectively.     Training is terminated if the cost function C < \\u03b4 (see (<ref>)), where \\u03b4_s = 1.0 % for \\u03b8_s and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 % for \\u03b8_a.      \\u00a7 PERFORMANCE MEASURES        In this section, we introduce feasible metrics to analyze and evaluate driving performance.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Modeling Performance        The modeling performance of the NN models can be evaluated by comparing original steering/pedaling trajectories (\\u03b8_s and \\u03b8_a) and predicted output trajectories (\\u03b8\\u0302_s and \\u03b8\\u0302_a), which are generated by the NN models from the original trajectories.     The following error metrics indicate the error differences between predicted driving actions estimated by the NNs and a driver's real driving actions at a discrete time sample k:   \\te_s, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_s [ k ] - \\u03b8_s [ k + \\u03c4],   \\te_a, p [ k ]    = \\u03b8\\u0302_a [ k ] - \\u03b8_a [ k + \\u03c4].  \\tThe normalized RMSEs, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each individual driving data are defined as:   \\tE\\u0305_s, p = E_s, p/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_s, p )/\\u03b8_s, M - \\u03b8_s, m,   \\tE\\u0305_a, p = E_a, p/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m =  RMS ( \\u1ebd_a, p )/\\u03b8_a, M - \\u03b8_a, m,      where \\u03b8_s, M, \\u03b8_s, m, \\u03b8_a, M, and \\u03b8_a, m are the maximum and minimum device angles obtained from the data of the experienced drivers used for the NN modeling (these values were also used for the training data normalization in Section\\u00a0<ref>). \\tE\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p quantify the similarity of the participant's driving skills to those of the experienced drivers captured in the NN models.        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Trajectory-based Skill Performance        The driving skill of each participant is broken down into steering and pedaling performance.     The steering performance is evaluated by a distance error e_d and an angular error e_\\u03b4 (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\te_d is the lateral distance between the virtual car position and the closest point on the (invisible) midline of the first lane. \\te_\\u03b4 is the angle between the car heading and the road frontal direction at the closest point on the midline. \\tWe use E_d = RMS ( \\u1ebd_d) and E_\\u03b4 = RMS ( \\u1ebd_\\u03b4) as indicators of the steering performance.  \\tFor the pedaling performance, we define a vehicle velocity error as e_v[k ] = v [ k ] - v_d, where v_d=62.64 km/h.     In our simulator, the target speed of 60 km/h corresponds to the actual speed of v_d when the speedometer needle reaches 60 km/h from the driver's viewpoint.     So E_v=RMS ( \\u1ebd_v) is a measure for the pedaling performance.     E_v is computed using only the velocity samples obtained after the vehicle speed first reaches v_d.     In addition, as a measure for the pedaling efficiency, we compute \\u03a9_a = RMS ( \\u03c9\\u0303_a), where \\u03c9_a[ k ] = |\\u03b8\\u0307_a[ k ] |, focusing on the pedaling speed. \\t\\u03a9_a increases if the participant operates the pedal more abruptly.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Driving Behavior Performance        Although the trajectory-based metrics can indicate average driving performance, analysis relying on them may overlook drivers' behavioral characteristics closely related to the drivers' decisions and negotiations under the circumstances.     Therefore, we need to analyze and display individual driving performance via behavioral analysis of human factors using the relevant field metrics, which are commonly used\\u00a0<cit.>.     In\\u00a0<cit.>, \\u00d6slund et al. have recommended useful driving behavioral metrics to assess the driving performance of intelligent vehicle systems.     We decided to adopt these metrics to further analyze driving performance.     Among the feasible metrics, three of them are selected to analyze behavioral performance in addition to trajectory-based metrics: steering wheel reversal rates (SRRs), acceleration reversal rates (ARRs), and time-to-line crossing (TLC), measuring steering efficiency, pedaling efficiency, and safety behavior in terms of time margin, respectively.      The reversal rate is used to analyze the efficiency of driving behavior.     It is defined as the number of device reversals per minute, where the total number of reversals divided by the total driving time.     A device reversal is counted up when the device angle rotates more than the specific angle gap after the direction of control is reversed.     For SRRs, we calculate SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, and SRR_8^\\u2218 according to the three gap sizes of 1^\\u2218, 4^\\u2218, and 8^\\u2218 to show the efficiency of microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic steering movements, respectively.     For ARRs, we select ARR_0.25^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218 considering that the accelerator pedal has a smaller control range than the steering wheel.      We also examine the data with a safety metric called time-to-line-crossing\\u00a0(TLC).     It is defined as the available time margin before any part of the vehicle reaches the lane boundary condition assuming the vehicle remains in its current state.     The TLC computation depends on the current vehicle state\\u00a0<cit.>.     The vehicle is assumed to continue on a straight, counter-clockwise or clockwise rotational trajectory when \\u03b8_s[ k ]=0^\\u2218, \\u03b8_s[ k ]<0^\\u2218 and \\u03b8_s[ k ]>0^\\u2218, respectively.     The time margin is then obtained by dividing the length of the assumed trajectory from the current location to the first intersection on the left/right boundary by the vehicle speed v [ k ].     For our lane-following task on the first lane, we selected the centerline as the left boundary and the dividing line between the first and second lane as the right boundary, respectively.     We separately compute TLC_fl[ k ] and TLC_fr[ k ] according to the relative positions of the left/right front wheels, and the actual safe time margin at k will be TLC[k]=min(TLC_fl[k], TLC_fr[k] ).     We select TLC_<1 as representative safety performance.     TLC_<1 is defined as the driving time with TLC less than a second divided by the total driving time, meaning the percentage of dangerous driving time.     \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0I: MODELING VALIDITY        Experiment\\u00a0I aims to logically show that our NN models (f_s and f_a) can capture expert driving skills.\\t     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Data Acquisition        The first goal of Experiment\\u00a0I is to validate whether the models work in generalized environments.     To this end, we designed longer, more complex paths by concatenating randomly-generated straight and curved segments, similar to <cit.>.     Each straight segment has one parameter, length L.     Each curved segment has two parameters: the radius of curvature R and the sweep angle \\u03d5 (Fig. <ref>).     The parameters are randomly chosen from 100\\u2013150 m (L and R) and \\u00b145^\\u2218\\u2013135^\\u2218 (\\u03d5; positive for left curves).     A straight segment is followed by a left or right curve with an equal probability.     A left (right) curve is followed by a straight segment with a probability of 0.4 and a right (left) curve with a probability of 0.6. \\tThe total length of each path is 4 km. \\t     We randomly generated many paths and selected one representative path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     Compared to the short and simple paths used for the training of NNs (Section\\u00a0<ref>), this path is considerably longer and more complex with arbitrary parameters of L, R, and \\u03d5. \\t        The same five experienced (: \\ud835\\udda4_1\\u2013\\ud835\\udda4_5) and 18 novice drivers (: \\ud835\\uddad_1\\u2013\\ud835\\uddad_18; all males, age 18\\u201328 years, M\\u00a022.8, SD\\u00a03.0) participated in collection of new driving data for the experiment.     The novice participants either did not have driving licenses or had licenses but very little actual driving experience[Young individuals who had not owned or driven a car/motorcycle in the past two years.].     We controlled the novice drivers' gender and age as these are important factors for human motor skill studies.      Only the novice participants had three practice trials in three 600-m short paths (\\u03d5=-90^\\u2218, 0^\\u2218,  90^\\u2218).     They were instructed to drive the car close to the center of the first lane while maintaining the 60 km/h speed. \\tThen they proceeded to the main trial.     Both the experienced and novice drivers completed the main trial on the 4-km long path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, left).     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results         \\tFig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results for an experienced (\\ud835\\udda4_4) and a novice (\\ud835\\uddad_11) driver.     They exhibited median performance for E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p in the respective groups.     The experienced driver's trajectories appear to be more consistent with the desired trajectories generated by the NNs.      The means of the 13 performance measures are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     We applied Welch's t-test (due to unequal sample sizes and unequal variances) to assess the effect of participant group ( and ) on each measure.     The means and the results of Welch's t-tests are also shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>.     All metrics showed that the  group performed better driving than the  group.     The  group showed significantly better performance than the  group in E\\u0305_s, p, E\\u0305_a, p, E_\\u03b4, and \\u03a9_a, and but not in E_d and E_v.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group demonstrated significantly better performance than the  group in SRR_8^\\u2218, ARR_0.25^\\u2218, and TLC_<1, but not in SRR_1^\\u2218, SRR_4^\\u2218, ARR_1^\\u2218, and ARR_2^\\u2218.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Discussion        There are three main findings we can acquire from the experiment.     First, our models built with experienced drivers' actual driving data on short and simple paths still predict their driving actions effectively on longer, complicated paths.     The normalized RMSEs of the  group (E\\u0305_s, p = 1.55 % and E\\u0305_a, p = 2.18 %) were similar to or less than the termination conditions of training (\\u03b4_s = 1.0 % and \\u03b4_a = 4.5 %) (Section\\u00a0<ref>).      Second, our models provide the skilled driving trajectories, the performance of which are similar to experienced drivers, and distinguished from superior to novice drivers.     The  group produced smaller normalized RMSEs (E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p) than the  group with statistical significance.     The  group also achieved better driving performance in every trajectory-based metric than , having statistically significant differences in E_\\u03b4 and \\u03a9_a.     In the behavioral analysis, the  group was shown to have more efficient behavior in macroscopic steering movements (lower SSR_1^\\u2218) than the  group.     The  group also had more efficient behavior in microscopic (ARR_0.25^\\u2218) and mesoscopic (ARR_2^\\u2218) pedaling movements.     It is also observable that the  group performed safer driving than the  group, maintaining longer time with enough TLC margins.     All these results indicate that the trained models can represent the specific driving skills of the experienced drivers, different from but better than those of the novice drivers.      Third, however, it should be noted that the NN models can also induce human-like characteristics, which are shared between experienced and novice drivers.     Although the  group and the  group demonstrated a large difference in SRR_8^\\u2218, the difference between the two groups was diminished as a smaller gap was applied.     The efficiency of microscopic steering movements (SRR_1^\\u2218) of the  group and that of the  group was almost same.     A similar result was already reported by a previous study\\u00a0<cit.>.     Therefore, no difference in the efficiency of microscopic steering movements can be regarded as a common, humane attribute regardless of a driving skill level.     This kind of natural human behavior could have been captured by our NN-based expert model.      \\u00a7 EXPERIMENT\\u00a0II: HAPTIC ASSISTANCE        Experiment\\u00a0II aims to assess the overall validity of the framework, that integrates our expert skill models with performance-based haptic assistance.     We compare three shared control methods, two of which are performance-based haptic assistance implemented in the form of haptic guidance.     Both guidance methods utilize the performance error e_\\u03b8 = \\u03b8 - \\u03b8_d.     However, our approach obtains \\u03b8_d estimated by the NN models (\\u03b8\\u0302), whereas the conventional one deterministically formulates \\u03b8_d with environmental variables.     \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Shared Control Methods    No Guidance (\\ud835\\uddad)      A driver receives only realistic haptic feedback (Section\\u00a0<ref>) while driving without any guidance.  \\t \\t Haptic Guidance with Neural Networks (\\ud835\\udda6)      A driver is assisted by performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angle is computed by the expert skill model (NNs) in real-time.     \\u03b8\\u0302_s[ k ] and \\u03b8\\u0302_a[ k ] estimated at 50 Hz are upsampled and smoothed to \\u03b8\\u0302_s( t ) and \\u03b8\\u0302_a( t ) by moving average filters for 800-Hz torque feedback.     The total steering torque feedback is   \\tT_s     = T_s, assist + T_s, stable,      where T_s, stable=-D_stable\\u03b8\\u0307_s with increased viscosity but without Coulomb friction for stable feedback (D_stable = 5D_s).     Aiming \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302, the assistive torque T_s, assist is computed using PID control such that   \\tT_s, assist ( t )= -( K_pid e_s ( t ) + I_pid \\u222b_t_0^te_s ( t' ) dt' + D_pid \\u0117_s ),   \\te_s = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d = \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8\\u0302_s,  \\twhere t_0 is the most recent time when e_s was zero.     K_pid = 0.60 N\\u00b7m/degree, I_pid = 0.12 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s^-1/degree, and D_pid = 0.06 N\\u00b7m\\u00b7s/degree.     Those assistance gains in this PID control are adjustable.     Therefore, this control logic can change the shared autonomy level between a driver and the driving system depending on the corresponding situation.       In this experiment, we allowed the gains to be strong enough to let the novice drivers effectively follow the path by enhanced feedback and even finish driving with proper pedal maneuvers even without holding the steering wheel (i.e., like autonomous steering).     However, to prevent the driver from the complete loss of human autonomy, the magnitude of gains is not excessively strong (mostly less than 10 Nm; smaller than human steering torque capability\\u00a0<cit.>), so that the driver can also overpower the wheel to fine-tune its angle.     We decided not to fix the driver's foot to the accelerator so that the driver can move the foot freely.     The driver's foot and the accelerator cannot always be in full contact, so unlike the steering wheel, we use unidirectional torque feedback for pedaling.     The total pedaling torque feedback is   \\tT_a = T_a, assist + T_a, spring + T_a, damping + g(\\u03b8_a).      To aim \\u03b8_d=\\u03b8\\u0302,   \\tT_a, assist ( t )     = \\t \\t\\t0,       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) < \\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t )   \\t\\t-K_a, max \\u00b7e_a ( t ),       if  \\u03b8_a ( t ) \\u2265\\u03b8\\u0302_a ( t ) \\t, \\t  \\te_a     = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d =  \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8\\u0302_a,  \\twhich replaces \\u03b8_a, max in (<ref>) with \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     With (<ref>), the accelerator presses the driver's foot upwards when the driver pushes the pedal deeper than \\u03b8\\u0302_a.     This control mechanism enables the driver to feel the desired pedal angle as an endpoint when pushing it.    Conventional Haptic Guidance (\\ud835\\udda2)      A driver is assisted by the conventional performance-based guidance feedback, where the desired angles are determined from the vehicle configuration relative to the driving environment, i.e., the path.     As such, \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\udda2 share the same torque feedback equations\\u00a0(<ref>) and\\u00a0(<ref>), but differ in how to determine \\u03b8_d.      For steering, we compute e_s (= \\u03b8_s - \\u03b8_s, d) as in the conventional predictive form of haptic steering guidance <cit.>.     The rationale is that guidance should be based on the future observation that a driver relies on to decide his/her current action.     This method considers two error terms, a look-ahead direction error e_p and the distance error e_d (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>). \\tThe desired angle \\u03b8_s, d is   \\t\\u03b8_s, d     = K_pe_p + K_de_d.      Using K_p=7.65, K_d=1.00degree/m, and the same PID gains of\\u00a0(<ref>) in \\ud835\\udda6, the driver can also finish driving with proper pedaling even without holding the steering wheel.      In the past, a few algorithms for pedaling feedback have been successfully implemented for specific goals such as safe car-following\\u00a0<cit.>, safe curve initiation\\u00a0<cit.>, or fuel efficiency\\u00a0<cit.>, but they are not yet generalized for performance-based haptic assistance.     In Experiment\\u00a0I, we realized that a novice driver could mistakenly accelerate due to little focus on pedals.     Thus, we designed haptic feedback that only provides overspeed cues for drivers to keep the same velocity.     We compute e_a as follows:   \\te_a = \\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, d     = \\t \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, max,       if  v < v_M,   \\t\\t\\u03b8_a - \\u03b8_a, min,       if  v \\u2265v_M. \\t      This equation replaces \\u03b8_a, d with \\u03b8_a, max or \\u03b8_a, min, concerning the criterion of overspeed[Exceeding 10 % from the target speed 60.0 km/h.] v_M=66.0 km/h.     When the vehicle velocity exceeds v_M, a constant magnitude of torque generated from the instantaneous change of two constant endpoint positions from \\u03b8_a, max to \\u03b8_a, min is added to the feedback.     As a result, the driver can feel immediate torque feedback from the foot as a warning sign of overspeed.       \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Experimental Protocol   \\t     We recruited the same 18 novice participants who participated in Experiment\\u00a0I.     To this end, we selected another randomly generated complex path (Fig.\\u00a0<ref>, right) to test three methods.     Each participant completed three driving trials on the path with one of the three methods in each trial, in a within-subject design.     The three methods were presented differently in a fully balanced order using all permutations across 18 participants.     Each participant was paid KRW 15,000 (\\u2243\\u00a0USD 13) after the experiment.      After each trial, the participants were asked to answer the following questions for both steering and pedaling feedback on a seven-point continuous scale:         (1) (Effectiveness) Was the training effective for your driving?; \\t\\t(2) (Comfort) Was the training comfortable?; \\t\\t(3) (Fun) Was the training fun?; and         (4) (Helpfulness) Would the training be helpful to improve your skill?        \\u00a7.\\u00a7 Results        Fig.\\u00a0<ref> shows exemplar results of different assistance conditions.     The resulted driving trajectories in every trial were analyzed using the same quantitative metrics used in Experiment\\u00a0I.     For statistical analysis, we applied a repeated-measures ANOVA with guidance method as the within-subject factor.     Tukey's test was conducted as a post-hoc test for significant effects.  Behavioral Similarity      We computed the normalized RMSEs as predictive errors, E\\u0305_s, p and E\\u0305_a, p, for each trajectory.     These metrics indicate how similar the participant's driving maneuvers are to the estimated outputs from the expert skill models.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>a.      The ascending order of E\\u0305_s, p was \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad.     The data of E\\u0305_s, p violated the assumption of sphericity (Mauchly's test, \\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 29.04, p < 0.001), and we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (\\u03f5 = 0.54).     Then we observed the significant effect of guidance method on E\\u0305_s, p (F(1.09, 18.51) = 34.27, p < 0.001).     The results of Tukey's test were \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad and \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad with statistical significance.      The order of E\\u0305_a, p was \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.     The assumption of sphericity was not violated (\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 5.92, p = 0.052), and there existed a significant effect of guidance method ( RPLUS MATCH ).     Tukey's test showed that \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 and \\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2 with significance.      The shared steering control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 became similar to the predicted output from the expert skill model.     When \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 assisted the novice drivers, the drivers achieved small predictive errors similar to the termination condition of training (\\u03b4_s=1.0 %).     However, the shared pedaling control in \\ud835\\udda6/\\ud835\\udda2 was in discord with the output from the expert skill model.     The drivers exhibited larger predictive errors of pedaling compared to the condition (\\u03b4_a=4.5 %).    Trajectory-based Skill Performance     \\tThe trajectory-based skill measures (E_d, E_\\u03b4, E_v, and \\u03a9_a) were calculated for each driving trajectory.     Their means are shown in Fig.\\u00a0<ref>b.  \\tThe ranking of E_d was \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\udda2, \\tand the assumption of sphericity was not violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 1.74, p = 0.418). \\tThere existed significant differences ( RPLUS MATCH ), and according to the post-hoc test, \\t\\t\\ud835\\uddad < \\ud835\\udda2. \\tThe ranking of E_\\u03b4 was         \\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad. \\tBecause the assumption of sphericity was violated \\t\\t(\\u03c7^2( 2 ) = 25.68, p < 0.001), \\tthe Greenhouse-Geisser estimate of sphericity (\\u03f5 = 0.56) was used for correction. \\tAs a result, there existed significant differences (F(1.11, 18.90) = 30.60, p < 0.001), and the post-hoc test showed \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda6 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\uddad, \\tand \\t\\t\\ud835\\udda2 < \\ud835\\udda6.

The AMS provides overall scores for each type of motivation, and each type is further distinguished into more specific motives: IM - to know describes actions performed for the pleasure and satisfaction derived from the learning, exploring, or trying to understand something new from an activity, IM - toward accomplishment relates to engaging in actions for the pleasure and satisfaction experienced when trying to achieve something new or beyond one's limits, IM - to experience stimulation describes the motivation related to the experiencing of pleasurable sensations, EM - externally regulated indicates the behaviour is motivated by reasons external to the task at hand, i.e., payment or rewards, EM - introjected refers to actions motivated by pressure an individual puts on themselves, and EM - identified describes behaviour that is motivated by the view that participation is important for personal growth <cit.>.
