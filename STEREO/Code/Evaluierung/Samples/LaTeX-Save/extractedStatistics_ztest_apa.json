        "{\"position\": null, \"sentence\": \"Thus, this result supports\\u00a0[H1].    Next, when comparing the FoCs for each Weight level (see Figure <ref> left), Tukey's post-hoc tests demonstrated that, for the W0 Weight, the FoC was significantly higher for the Target task than for the other tasks (both p<.05).       In contrast, for the W25, W50, W75 levels of Weight, the FoC was significantly lower for the Free task than for the other tasks (all p<.05).     Finally, for the W100 Weight, the post-hoc tests did not exhibit any significant difference.  Thus, these results only support [H2] partially, as although the Free task (the less constrained task) consistently obtained the lowest FoC ratings (except for the W100), this effect was not visible between Target and Trajectory tasks.       As the ANOVA analysis indicated that the strongest effects originated from the Weight factor, to further characterize the relationship between FoC and the Weight factor, a linear regression analysis was conducted across participants for each task (Figure <ref> right).  The regression equations were   Free:  y    = 0.0487x + 1.77 (R^2=0.83)   Target:  y    = 0.0379x + 2.94 (R^2=0.65)   Trajectory:  y    = 0.0444x + 2.49 (R^2=0.73).   The regression equations exhibited linear positive correlations between the FoC and the Weight.  To determine whether the computed slopes differed significantly from 0, we computed the slope of each participant\\u2019s linear regression and conducted a t-test (H_0: Slope is equal to 0): (Free:  RPLUS MATCH ,  Target:   RPLUS MATCH ,  Trajectory:  RPLUS MATCH ).  The results of the t-test indicated that the mean slopes all significantly differed from 0.  These results further support [H1].  Section\\u00a0<ref> further analyzes the FoC ratings in correlation with the IPC scores.      \\u00a7.\\u00a7.\\u00a7 Task Completion Time     Because the task completion time was dependent on the weights of the two participants (their sum adding to 100%), for the task completion time analysis, the Weight group  factor had only three levels: W0-W100, W25-W75, and W50-W50 (see Figure\\u00a0<ref>).  In addition, owing to the different natures of each task (aimed movement, path following task), we did not assess the differences among Tasks for the task completion time.  Therefore, we conducted three Friedman tests considering Weight group as a factor, one for each task.  The Friedman tests exhibited significant differences among the task completion times of the Weight groups only for  the Free task (\\u03c7^2=14, p < .001), and no significant differences were found for the Target task (\\u03c7^2=0.17, p = .92) or the Trajectory task: (\\u03c7^2=3.5, p = .17).  Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that for the Free task, the task completion time was significantly smaller in the W0-W100 condition  (W0-W100 < W25-W75: Z=-2.81, p<.01,  W0-W100 < W50-W50: Z=-3.30, p<.01).
