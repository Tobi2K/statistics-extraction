A system receiving high scores in the HQF dimensions, is considered presentable, professional, of good taste, and bringing users close to each other.    * Cluster 4: 10 items on the subjective perception of the system's attractiveness (ATT), which is the hedonic dimension that gives rise to behaviors as increased use, or dissent, as well as, emotions as happiness, engagement, or frustration.     * Cluster 5: 4 items assessing the type of professions seniors would endorse to the proposed agents, among which were welfare, housework, security, and front desk jobs.    * Cluster 6: 3 items assessing agent's age range preferences.    Each questionnaire item required a response given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly agree to 5=strongly disagree (3=I don't know)
The cluster is coupled with a single-cycle latency multi-banked L1 memory (64 kB) allowing fast data transfer among the cores, and with an 'off the cluster' 512 kB of memory (L2) with 15 cycles latency

In combination with the Interface Dynamics, this results in a new system state x_n+1. The state (or partial information thereof, see Section <ref>) is then fed back to the controller, which again selects the next control u_n+1^* based on this information, i.e., a sensorimotor control loop between Human and Computer is established (see Figure <ref>(b)). In particular, the optimal state trajectory x^* does not only depend on the control sequence u, but also vice versa. Since in such models, feedback is given to the controller during execution, these models are often denoted as  optimal feedback control (OFC) models <cit.>. It is important to note that with many OCP solution methods that take into account feedback during execution (including the ones presented in this paper), the actual optimization can be performed offline, i.e., before the controls are applied to the actual system dynamics

This result implies that sensory integration of auditory and visual contents increases the classification accuracy, even for RSMP BCIs.  The online classification accuracy was 85.7±11.5% when SOA was 250 ms.  The offline mean ITR was 11.3 bit/min at best (SOA = 250 ms, R=3).   Since RSMP can be used in gaze-independent BCIs, our study provides insight into methods that can be used to develop a new gaze-independent BCIs.    Our findings indicated that the AV condition was associated with the best performance among all three conditions,  in accordance with the findings of previous P300-based BCI studies

Relative position preservation is measured by the angular orientation error, , defined by Heilmann et al. <cit.> and obtained by computing the average change in the slope of the line between the centroids of pairs of regions.    Topological Accuracy:  Topological accuracy is measured with the adjacency error : the fraction of the regional adjacencies that the cartogram fails to preserve, i.e., = 1 - |E_c∩ E_m|/|E_c∪ E_m|, where E_c and E_m are respectively the adjacencies between regions in the cartogram and the original map.   Alam et al. <cit.> used these measures to compare five cartogram algorithms

Finally, our method provides users with validation information that is both intuitive and easy to interpret.    This remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  It begins with a review of related work, then describes the details of the IR methodology.  We then share example results from a variety of proof-of-concept systems that have adopted the IR technique.  These examples range from simple bar charts to more sophisticated interactive visualizations of large scale event data collections <cit.>.

In this study, the questionnaire on pre-task empathy toward the agent was given only to confirm that there were no differences between participants.  Therefore, we do not discuss significant differences between the pre- and post-task cases.   The post-task results showed no interaction between task difficulty and task content, regardless of empathy category.  For the 12 items, there was also no main effect of each factor [F(1,564) = 2.4737].  Similarly, no main effect of task content was found [F(1,564) = 0.5918]
We used a random intercept term accounting for individual differences as random effects.  The regression model indicated a large effect of causation statement plausibility (context), χ^2=162.70, η_partial^2=0.274,p<0.001, a small effect of visualization design (χ^2=11.65,η_partial^2=0.026,p<0.01), and negligible interaction effect between causation statement plausibility (context) and visualization design (χ^2=0.97,η_partial^2=0.002,p=0.81)

The most important metrics were (TO)fair and (TO)pay (Notice that we use the term “(TO)” to distinguish these metrics from the metrics that TurkerView has).  More than half of the respondents (78%) considered that the (TO)fair metric was more than very important (“5 - extremely important” and “4 - very important”) when they selected HITs
Assuming the voltage applied to a person is V^app and the current flowing in the body is I^flo, the relationship with the voltage V_n applied across the resistor R_n can be written as follows:    V^app=V_1·R_1+R_2/R_1-V_3 I^flo=V_3/R_3.
 In this paper, the resistances R_1 = 0.2 M Ω, R_2 = 1.8 M Ω, and R_3 = 100 Ω were used
Participants' responses had a high level of consistency for both questions, similar to prior studies (Cronbach α [Need for Self-Reflection]: 0.97, Cronbach α [Insight]: 0.95) <cit.>

However, because that step is not yet accepted by all data science projects and may happen at different stages, we have listed that step separately at the end of the horizontal axis of the stacked bar chart in Figure <ref>.      §.§.§ Where do Non-Technical Roles Work?   The data for Figure <ref> show highly significant differences from one column to the next column (χ^2_48 = 148.777, p< .001).    Through a close examination of Figure <ref>, we found that the degree of involvement by Managers/Executives and by Communicators is roughly synchronized—despite their seeming lack of collaboration patterns as seen in Figures <ref> and <ref>
We did not find significant effects of bubble radius on the resulting BubbleView clicks (Exp. 1,3,5).  Across all our experiments (Exp. 1–5), we found that a blur kernel sigma in the range of 30–50 pixels was appropriate for all of our image types, where we manually selected a sigma value for each image dataset to ensure that text was unintelligible when blurred and would require explicit clicking on to read
All participants whose data were excluded were still rewarded for their time.      Data from 62 participants were analysed, 25 men (40%), 36 women (58%) and one who identified as non-binary.  Age ranged from 18–24 to over 65, with the majority being in the 25–44 years range (71%, see Table <ref>).  Educational level ranged from high school education to postgraduate degree, with the majority having a bachelors or postgraduate degree (73%, see Table <ref>).  As the experimental task involves reading and listening, participants were asked whether they had a visual or hearing impairment, none reported any.  For the same reason, participants were asked about their proficiency in English; 98% (61/62) rated it as good or excellent, and one as average
Overall mean rating was 4.81 (SD = 1.25) for goal-oriented clips, 4.16 (SD = 1.52) for aimless clips, and 2.43 (SD = 1.54) for no-play clips

Furthermore, if we analyze the distribution of the data, we can observe that players of Self-Improvement score systems performed, on average, a high (near maximum) number of takes (M≈3.64,  Mdn≈3.86, SD≈0.37), while oppositely, players of the Extremely Altruistic score system performed a low number of takes (M≈-.58, Mdn≈-.57, SD≈0.42).  Even though the differences are clearly noticeable, we can also observe that the Self-Improvement data is closer to the maximum number of takes, than the altruistic version is to the minimum number of takes
The Jaccard similarity between two sets C_1 and C_2 is defined as J(C_1, C_2) = |C_1 ∩ C_2|/|C_1 ∪ C_2| and scales between 0 (the sets are disjoint) and 1 (the sets are identical)
Note that to control for Type-I error inflation in our multiple comparisons (presented in this section), we used the Holm Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate (FWER) <cit.>, at the significance level of α < .05.     §.§ What Mood Were the Users In?  The 8 non-neutral moods measured by PAM, can be grouped into four mood categories <cit.>; activated-pleasant (excited, cheerful), deactivated-pleasant (relaxed, calm), activated-unpleasant (tense, irritated), and deactivated-unpleasant (bored, sad).    Among the 284 workers, 147 workers (51%) were found to be in activated-pleasant moods (95 were cheerful and 52 were excited), 62 workers (22%) were in deactivated-pleasant moods (35 were calm, 27 were relaxed). 20 workers (7%) were in activated-unpleasant moods (16 were tense, 4 were irritated) and 33 (12%) were in deactivated-unpleasant moods (19 were sad, 14 were bored). 22 workers (8%) claimed to be in a neutral mood

Doing so allows us to represent the fact that humans learn individually, while recognizing that the trained AI algorithm has the potential to observe all game rounds seen so far regardless of which human user is playing.                   §.§ Selection of queried instances  We select the individual audio samples to be played to the user in the game with equal probability such that the bonafide and spoofed audio files were each sampled with a probability of p=0.5.

Our generated friction model is implemented at the BMW bobsled simulator  which is being used by the German bobsleigh national team for preparation for the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.       §.§ Related work       §.§.§ Longitudinal friction   The majority of research for steel-ice friction focuses on longitudinal friction, i.e.  the frictional force which acts against the driving direction when driving straightly.  There are different kinds of experimental setups to investigate ice friction.  For example, <cit.> utilized an iced centrifuge with a slider gliding over a flat surface. <cit.> used a modified tire test bench, where the slider glides in a concave curvature  and determined a range for the longitudinal friction coefficient μ_x = 7-16 · 10^-3. <cit.> also tested the influence of speed and temperature and found a lower limit for the friction coefficient  μ_x≥ 8 · 10^-3 under their experimental conditions.  Unlike rotational devices, linear devices are better suited to investigate ice friction on a fresh surface <cit.>. <cit.> also pointed out that devices where a slider repeatedly glides over the same surface could lead to misinterpretation due to frictional heating. <cit.> conducted  ski-sport specific tests on a 24m linear tribometer
The system's hardware and setup remained the same with Section <ref>.  Given that the most related works <cit.> conducted their evaluation studies with 12 users, we recruited 12 participants for the evaluation.  All of them had not participated in our previous experiments and were right-handed.  The participants aged from 19 to 22 (AVG = 20.25, SD = 0.63), including 5 females and 7 males.  Half of the participants had at least moderate experience with virtual reality.  The average self-reported virtual reality familiarity was 2.58 (1: Not familiar at all; 7: Very familiar).       §.§ Results   We conducted the Bartlett's test and validated that the assumption of sphericity had not been violated on the metrics of the task completion time(χ^2 = 2.09, p > 0.05), RULA score(χ^2 = 0.14, p > 0.05), physical elbow(χ^2 = 8.78, p > 0.05), physical wrist(χ^2 = 7.93, p > 0.05)
From the dataset of 176 participants described in the previous section, 100 participants are randomly selected as the training dataset D_train; similarly, 50 participants are separately selected at random as the test dataset D_test.  Considering the various sampling rates of D_test, I prepare several types of D_test, ranging from 100 Hz (D_test^100) to 50 Hz (D_test^50), 25 Hz, 12.5 Hz, and 6.25 Hz via downsampling, and I verify the accuracy of each
All of them were diagnosed with dyslexia, with ages ranging from 6 to 11 years (x̅= 8.79, s = 1.44).  Using the TALE scores, we split them into two age groups of the same size according to their literacy skills, which coincidentally matched perfectly with their school year
Interestingly, even during social breaks, many users (14–18 users) chose to stay in the virtual world and network with each other

The methodology does this by      * explicitly including multiple FactSheet consumers and producers in FactSheet requirements gathering (Steps 1–2)     * asking questions about their concerns for harm and risk (Steps 1–2)     * providing a feedback mechanism to allow further input (Step 6)    * including a broad range of perspectives in the development of FactSheets (Steps 1–7)    This process will increase the likelihood that FactSheets will provide the information needed to understand and mitigate potential harm or safety issues with an AI system.    § ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We thank Karthik Muthuraman, Saishruthi Swaminathan, and the MAX model team for their collaboration in creating FactSheets for MAX models
The results indicate that 3D maps can significantly reduce the task completion time in finding either annotated or unannotated targets.  Especially in Task 2 of finding unannotated landmarks, the mean completion time of using a 2D map (t=430) is more than twice that of using a 3D map (t=211)

Since the objective is to evaluate the model both in terms of goal awareness score and accuracy,   we utilize a measure similar in spirit to the F-Measure <cit.>, which we term as the GO-measure and is defined as:           GO_1(goal) = 2 ·accuracy ·P(dc|goal)/(accuracy) + P(dc|goal)     where P(dc| goal) is the average value of P(dc| goal) for the predicted data command dc across the test examples for the specified goal.            The GO_1 scores of the proposed models and fine-tuned models are reported in Tables <ref> and <ref> respectively, with goal-wise results plotted in Figure <ref>

Different from the typical questionnaire analysis, this paper focuses on the computational analysis of GUX.  We aim to analyze the relationship between game and players using the multi-modal data including physiological data and game process data.  We theoretically extend the Flow model from the classic skill-and-challenge plane by expanding new dimension on motivation, which is the result of the multi-modal data analysis on affect, and physiological data.  We call this 3D Flow as Motivational Flow, MovFlow.  Meanwhile, we implement a quantitative GUX Analysis System (GUXAS), which can predict the player’s in-game experience state by only using game process data.  It analyzes the correlation among not only in-game state, but the player’s psychological-and-physiological reaction in the entire interactive game-play process.  The experiments demonstrated our MovFlow model efficiently distinguished the users’ in-game experience states from the perspective of GUX.          <ccs2012>    <concept>        <concept_id>10003120.10003121.10003122</concept_id>        <concept_desc>Human-centered computing HCI design and evaluation methods</concept_desc>        <concept_significance>500</concept_significance>        </concept>    <concept>        <concept_id>10010405.10010455.10010459</concept_id>        <concept_desc>Applied computing Psychology</concept_desc>        <concept_significance>300</concept_significance>        </concept>    <concept>        <concept_id>10010147.10010257.10010258.10010259.10010263</concept_id>        <concept_desc>Computing methodologies Supervised learning by classification</concept_desc>        <concept_significance>300</concept_significance>        </concept>    <concept>        <concept_id>10010147.10010257.10010258.10010260.10003697</concept_id>        <concept_desc>Computing methodologies Cluster analysis</concept_desc>        <concept_significance>500</concept_significance>        </concept>  </ccs2012>   [500]Human-centered computing HCI design and evaluation methods [300]Applied computing Psychology [300]Computing methodologies Supervised learning by classification [500]Computing methodologies Cluster analysis          GUX-Analyzer: A Deep Multi-modal Analyzer Via Motivational Flow For Game User Experience     Lin Yuan     October 9, 2022 ========================================================================================      § INTRODUCTION     Game User eXperience (GUX) is understood as the subjective relationship between users and games, which refers to the perception and the user's responses during the game-play <cit.>

Because there exists an inconclusive state, they are kept as two separate hypotheses, in a way similar to 𝐇_1 and 𝐇_2.  When model M+ is trained with extra information, the model may learn new capability from the extra information, while losing some capability that would be learned without the extra information

Unfortunately, the virtual keyboard can be inefficient and uses valuable screen space on already small devices.  Recent advances in stylus input make handwriting a potentially viable text input solution for programming on touchscreen devices.   The primary barrier, however, is that handwriting recognition systems are built to take advantage of the rules of natural language, not those of a programming language

These sums were divided by 20 to calculate the average perceivable force across the hand.  Smaller perceived forces equate to better tactile perception.   One participant in the VTS condition is not included in these calculations because their starting measures prevent representation on the graphs.  This user initially presented as insensate at all points, but could accurately report deep pressure sensation at three points later in the study.     Starting means[Mean sum of force levels for the hand (sum of 20 points).] (M=832.4 grams, SD=1206 for VTS; M=501.6 grams, SD=949.7 for control) were compared using Mann–Whitney U test (U=18; z=-1.10; p=0.271).  Baseline measures of the VTS experimental group were compared to measures at eight weeks (M=9.701 grams, SD=14.25) and results suggest that there is a significant difference (t-test: t(6)=-3.50; p=0.006; signed-ranks: Z=-1.89; p0.05).   As figure <ref> shows, the VTS condition is able to sense smaller forces than the control condition at eight weeks (M=91.15  grams, SD=224.1).  The sham control condition also showed a change in SWME measures, but this change was not statistically significant (t-test: t(7)=1.190; p=0.254; signed-ranks: Z=-1.40; p0.05).   Figure <ref> shows the trends in these values throughout the entire study.                §.§ Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)  Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was measured in a clinical setting for flexion and extension of MCP/PIP finger joints, thumb, wrist, elbow, and shoulder.  Here, results are reported for the fingers which showed the most change in values.  MAS values here are reported on a scale of 0-5 and summed for the fingers.    Starting means (M=6.28, SD=2.16 for VTS; M=4.5, SD=1.46 for control) were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test (U=16; z=1.63; p=0.052)  and no significant difference was found.

When a new task is desired at timestep t, a worker will be prompted to propose a new task, which is then added to the set of all tasks, and N_t+1 = N_t+1.  Later, other workers can submit responses to this new task so that a label for that task can be inferred.  In this model, the cost of a new task generated by the crowd and the cost of a response is defined to be f_t and f_r units, respectively

It takes only a few seconds to attach the sensor to a limb, a routine that can easily be integrated into general handling of the infant, e.g., during play.       We also recorded some meta information for this dataset.  For example, 'head position' was recorded based on the position of the infant's head as   either `Left', `Right' or `Midline'.   `Left' and `Right' were determined as the infant having turning their head over 30° away from the midline in either direction.   In order to constrain the requirements of our approach to what is feasible in real-life application scenarios we did not use the head position information, even though it may provide important context.    The other meta information we recorded is the quality of the trials.  Unqualified trials were excluded for this study, such as   when the infant had rolled their front, or the infant was crying/ sneezing/ sick/ coughing etc.  As a result, we obtained a number of continuous trials each 4-10 minutes in length.  A professional trained in GMA observed each video and classified infant movements as normal (TD) or abnormal (AM).   Age information were also included, as shown in Table. <ref>.     §.§ Data Pre-processing   After removing some unqualified/ corrupted trials, we had 161 validated continuous trials (some longer trials were broken into shorter ones).  Each trial contained four sets of synchronised sequences that corresponded to the four accelerometers fixed on the infant's four limbs.  Each accelerometer dataset (collected from a limb) consisted of three axis data (x, y and z) and their Signal Vector Magnitude as a complementary dimension, i.e., 4 channels (per limb).  The trial length was roughly 4-10 minutes, i.e., 24k-60k of samples.   Each trial was labeled indicating whether the data came from a typical developing (TD) infant or an infant with abnormal movements (AM).  In total, there were 64 positive trials (AM) and 97 negative trials (TD).        For data processing, we employed the sliding window approach without any window/frame overlapping

We first map points from a plane to points on the surface of a cylinder.  Without loss of generality, let the cylinder lie tangentially on the plane and the intersection line with the plane is the y-axis so that its axis is parallel to the y-axis, and has diameter d.  Then, the projected coordinate (x,y,z) of a point (X,Y,0) on the plane on this cylinder is computed as:      (x,y,z) = (d^2 · X/d^2+X^2,Y,d · X^2/d^2+X^2)     We now describe how to extend the above approach when the scene contains the buildings of the city

§ APPENDIX       §.§ View Composition Algebra       §.§.§ Statistical Composition with Nonexact Schemas   We describe the safety rules for statistical composition V^*=V_1⊙_op V_2 in cases where the set of grouping attributes A_gb^1 in Q_1  is a strict super set of A_gb^2 in Q_2.     Q^*    = π_A_gb^1, Q_1.y op Q_2.y→y (Q_1 _A_gb^2 Q_2)    R^*    = R_1   Q^* is defined over the left outer join of  Q_1 and Q_2.  This join ensures that rows in Q_1 are preserved in the join result, but rows in Q_2 that do not have a join match are not in the output
In addition, participated therapists expressed  higher trust on Condition 3 (μ = 4.73) than the others (Condition 1: μ = 4.60, p = 0.42 and Condition 2: μ = 3.833, p = 0.18)
We represent a state diagram as a directed graph G=(V, E, S, T) where S is the start state and T={T_1, T_2, ..., T_n} contains the end states where tasks are accomplished
Given the solution (0,…,2) to problem (<ref>), at step p(≥ m) of the task, the AR device provides assistance by displaying to the user the shortest path between locations p(=p) and p+1 in the form of world-locked digital breadcrumbs in the heads-up display
This work will provide the affective computing community with new knowledge and tools for feature extraction from video sequences that can provide for transparency of future results, ease of use for researchers and provide ground-work towards shared standard feature sets in a fashion similar to that of speech <cit.>.  00 b1R
Then we offer a computational intelligence driven scheme for recovering the corresponding emotion from its body gestures. §.§ A  Fresnel Zone based Look-up Method
 Unlike previous similar research <cit.> relying on the empirical experiences for system setup, we present  theoretic analysis  based on Fresnel Zones instead.
 Fig. <ref> shows an example of the Fresnel zone, which consists of a set of concentric ellipsoids:
 x^2/a_n^2+y^2/b_n^2  =1, n=1⋯N
 where Q_n(a_n,b_n) is a boundar point of the nth Fresnel zone.  Tx and Rx represent the sender and receiver, respectively.
 For wireless signal with wavelength λ, the corresponding Fresnel zones can be constructed as follows,
 |TxQ_n|+|Q_nRx|-|TxRx| = n λ/2
 WiFi signal, whether it is running on 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, can hardly penetrate human beings

A route r_i = < V_i, E_i > is a list of vertices V_i = ( v_i,0, v_i, 1, …, v_i, n) representing the stops along the way, as well as a list of edges E_i = ( e_i,0, e_i, 1, …, e_i, n-1) representing the path between them.  Unlike some road networks that model only the major cities in the network using vertices, the georeferenced graph uses vertices with specific geographic positions to model the geometry of the road

This process is repeated for multiple bounding boxes until an end token is generated:       t_t = Transformer([b_1...t-1; c])  t_t is then projected to the appropriate dimensionality to parametrize the GMM models with various projection layers W_xy and W_wh to model P(x_t, y_t), the distribution of the bounding boxes' positions, and P(w_t, h_t), the distribution of the bounding boxes' sizes
Its VR display device is Oculus Rift with a resolution of 1280*800
We calculated a Kappa value for each criterion: specific goals (κ=0.6), deliverable (κ=0.7), non-urgent (κ=0.5), and trivial/invalid (κ=0.8)
We use Armijo line search with coefficient α=0.8 to determine the step size
Thus, the profile of X, i.e., gp(X), is defined as follows:        gp(X)=∑_i=1^nω_if^p_i/∑_i=1^nω_i        ω_i=7-r + n + 1/∑_k=1^nk   where ω_i is the weight of each picture and depends on the collection size n and the rank r of the considered picture
Similarly, 67 out of the 91 survey participants that only used a commercial VPN believed their VPN provider collects data about them.  Most of them believed that this data collection was for advertising purposes (48/91), and also a default consequence of the Internet (40/91).  For this survey question, there was a significant correlation between the responses given by all participants and participants that only used commercial VPNs, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.976 (p ≪ 0.001).   Thus, regardless of who provides their VPN or why they use it, students believed they were being tracked.      §.§.§ Awareness of collection, but not access & sharing        Interview We asked interview participants about their opinion on VPN data sharing practices.  When asked whether they thought their VPN providers could be sharing their information, 17/32 responded “no” and 11/32 “yes”, but 12/32 were uncertain about their response, because they did not feel like they would be able to know anyway

To capture workload fast and efficiently during VR, we used a single item scale ranging from 0 to 220 (220 = highest) called SEA scale <cit.>, a German version of the Rating Scale Mental Effort <cit.>.        Preference Rankings Participants were asked to order the three body weight modification methods concerning their workload, perceived body weight estimation difficulty, vividness, contentment, and overall preference
Let d be a text collection with n number of words w.    d=[w_1,w_2,....,w_n]   A word w_i is a vector of 8 elements, representing the properties of each word, e ϵ [0,1]:   w_i=[e_1,e_2,....,e_8]    Assuming element e can only have two decimals (i.e. e can have one out of 101 possible values), the number of possible vector permutations for a word w is 101^8.  A document d with n number of words has:   (101^8)^n   possible permutations
We also consider the three cases illustrated in fig:SamplingSpecificActions in our sample selection.
  Given a count of past actions { c_i } for the n candidates, the probability of picking candidate k is: p_k = 1/max(c_k, 1)/∑_i = 1^n1/max(c_i, 1)
 When an animation has been used, its counter is updated as: c_k = c_k + α ,
 where α is a weight determining how quickly the probability decreases the more often a motion is used

As shown in Figure <ref> (a zoomed-in node of Figure <ref> 2), each node can have one or more named inputs (a_2) and outputs (a_3), which are used to connect nodes.  Inspired by several existing node-edge-based visual programming platforms[Maya: <https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview>; Node-RED: <https://nodered.org/>], we provide node previews to increase chaining transparency, including a status icon highlighting whether the node contains errors (Figure <ref>a_1), as well as inline and detailed data views (a_3 and a_4).    Node Types.  As summarized in Figure <ref>, we define several types of nodes to cover diverse user needs
ACM uses two types of these constructs:  theorem-like and definition-like.  Here is a theorem:    Let f be continuous on [a,b].  If G is   an antiderivative for f on [a,b], then        ∫^b_af(t) dt = G(b) - G(a).      Here is a definition:    If z is irrational, then by e^z we mean the   unique number that has   logarithm z:        loge^z = z.      The pre-defined theorem-like constructs are theorem, conjecture, proposition, lemma and corollary.  The pre-defined de­fi­ni­ti­on-like constructs are example and definition.  You can add your own constructs using the amsthm interface <cit.>.  The styles used in the  command are acmplain and acmdefinition.  Another construct is proof, for example,     Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number L such that        lim_x→∞ f(x)/g(x) = L.      Then        l=lim_x→c f(x)     = lim_x→c     [ gx ·f(x)/g(x) ]     = lim_x→c g(x) ·lim_x→c     f(x)/g(x) = 0·L = 0,      which contradicts our assumption that l≠ 0.     § CONCLUSIONS  This paragraph will end the body of this sample document

This value was not directly used as the time interval of one-tenth second was too small and may result in unnecessary noise in the calculation of speed and density.   d = √((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2)   Instead, we used one second as out basic unit of time and summed d. values for each second eq:avdis, where n=10.    D = ∑_i=1^n (d)   Once the average distance was obtained for each second (Δ T), it was used to calculate speed and acceleration

Respondents who chose to leave their email address for the lottery were assured that the e-mail addresses would be separated from the questionnaire data.  We also discarded certain responses from the total 309 attempts of the questionnaire to ensure data quality.  We excluded 30 responses for leaving after the first few questions (26), declining to provide consent (3), and selecting "Strongly Agree" across all Likert scales, which suggests that each statement was not read carefully (1).      §.§ Respondent Demographics                                        We received a total of 279 valid responses.   Average survey completion time was 6.8 minutes (Md[Md = median] = 6.2).  Table <ref> shows a summary of respondents' demographics and work experience.   They worked across six continents with the largest number of respondents in North America, which was likely because it shared the largest number of companies and was where the survey was distributed from
